  <p>To deprive Instruction of the terrors with which the young but too
  often regard it, and strew flowers upon the pathways that lead to
  Knowledge, is to confer a benefit upon all who are interested in the
  cause of Education, either as Teachers or Pupils. The design of the
  following pages is not merely to present to the youthful reader some
  of the masterpieces of English literature in prose and verse,
  arranged and selected in such a manner as to please as well as
  instruct, but to render them more agreeable to the eye and the
  imagination by Pictorial Representations, in illustration of the
  subjects. It is hoped that this design has not been altogether
  unsuccessful, and that the ILLUSTRATED LONDON READING BOOK will
  recommend itself both to old and young by the appropriateness of the
  selections, their progressive arrangement, the fidelity of their
  Illustrations, and the very moderate price at which it is offered to
  the public.</p>

  <p>It has not been thought necessary to prefix to the present Volume
  any instructions in the art of Elocution, or to direct the accent or
  intonation of the student by the abundant use of italics or of large
  capitals. The principal, if not the only secrets of good reading are,
  to speak slowly, to articulate distinctly, to pause judiciously, and
  to feel the subject so as, if possible, &quot;to make all that passed
  in the mind of the Author to be felt by the Auditor,&quot; Good oral
  example upon these points is far better for the young Student than
  the most elaborate written system.</p>

  <p>A series of Educational Works, in other departments of study,
  <i>similarly illustrated,</i> and at a price equally small, is in
  preparation. Among the earliest to be issued, may be enumerated a
  Sequel and Companion to the ILLUSTRATED LONDON READING BOOK, designed
  for a more advanced class of Students, and consisting of extracts
  from English Classical Authors, from the earliest periods of English
  Literature to the present day, with a copious Introductory Chapter
  upon the arts of Elocution and Composition. The latter will include
  examples of Style chosen from the beauties of the best Authors, and
  will also point out by similar examples the Faults to be avoided by
  all who desire to become, not simply good Readers and Speakers, but
  elegant Writers of their native language.</p>

  <p>Amongst the other works of which the series will be composed, may
  be mentioned, profusely Illustrated Volumes upon Geographical,
  Astronomical, Mathematical, and General Science, as well as works
  essential to the proper training of the youthful mind.</p>

  <p>Nothing could be more easy and agreeable than my condition when I
  was first summoned to set out on the road to learning, and it was not
  without letting fall a few ominous tears that I took the first step.
  Several companions of my own age accompanied me in the outset, and we
  travelled pleasantly together a good part of the way.</p>

  <p>We had no sooner entered upon our path, than we were accosted by
  three diminutive strangers. These we presently discovered to be the
  advance-guard of a Lilliputian army, which was seen advancing towards
  us in battle array. Their forms were singularly grotesque: some were
  striding across the path, others standing with their arms a-kimbo;
  some hanging down their heads, others quite erect; some standing on
  one leg, others on two; and one, strange to say, on three; another
  had his arms crossed, and one was remarkably crooked; some were very
  slender, and others as broad as they were long. But, notwithstanding
  this diversity of figure, when they were all marshalled in line of
  battle, they had a very orderly and regular appearance. Feeling
  disconcerted by their numbers, we were presently for sounding a
  retreat; but, being urged forward by our guide, we soon mastered the
  three who led the van, and this gave us spirit to encounter the main
  army, who were conquered to a man before we left the field. We had
  scarcely taken breath after this victory, when, to our no small
  dismay, we descried a strong reinforcement of the enemy, stationed on
  the opposite side. These were exactly equal in number to the former
  army, but vastly superior in size and stature; they were, in fact, a
  race of giants, though of the same species with the others, and were
  capitally accoutred for the onset. Their appearance discouraged us
  greatly at first, but we found their strength was not proportioned to
  their size; and, having acquired much skill and courage by the late
  engagement, we soon succeeded in subduing them, and passed off the
  field in triumph. After this we were perpetually engaged with small
  bands of the enemy, no longer extended in line of battle, but in
  small detachments of two, three, and four in company. We had some
  tough work here, and now and then they were too many for us. Having
  annoyed us thus for a time, they began to form themselves into close
  columns, six or eight abreast; but we had now attained so much
  address, that we no longer found them formidable.</p>

  <p>After continuing this route for a considerable way, the face of
  the country suddenly changed, and we began to enter upon a vast
  succession of snowy plains, where we were each furnished with a
  certain light weapon, peculiar to the country, which we flourished
  continually, and with which we made many light strokes, and some
  desperate ones. The waters hereabouts were dark and brackish, and the
  snowy surface of the plain was often defaced by them. Probably, we
  were now on the borders of the Black Sea. These plains we travelled
  across and across for many a day.</p>

  <p>Upon quitting this district, the country became far more dreary:
  it appeared nothing but a dry and sterile region, the soil being
  remarkably hard and slatey. Here we saw many curious figures, and we
  soon found that the inhabitants of this desert were mere ciphers.
  Sometimes they appeared in vast numbers, but only to be again
  suddenly diminished.</p>

  <p>Our road, after this, wound through a rugged and hilly country,
  which was divided into nine principal parts or districts, each under
  a different governor; and these again were reduced into endless
  subdivisions. Some of them we were obliged to decline. It was not a
  little puzzling to perceive the intricate ramifications of the paths
  in these parts. Here the natives spoke several dialects, which
  rendered our intercourse with them very perplexing. However, it must
  be confessed that every step we set in this country was less
  fatiguing and more interesting. Our course at first lay all up hill;
  but when we had proceeded to a certain height, the distant country,
  which is most richly variegated, opened freely to our view.</p>

  <p>I do not mean at present to describe that country, or the
  different stages by which we advance through its scenery. Suffice it
  to say, that the journey, though always arduous, has become more and
  more pleasant every stage; and though, after years of travel and
  labour, we are still very far from the Temple of Learning, yet we
  have found on the way more than enough to make us thankful to the
  kindness of the friends who first set us on the path, and to induce
  us to go forward courageously and rejoicingly to the end of the
  journey.</p>

  <h2>PEKIN.</h2>

  <p>Pekin, or Peking, a word which in Chinese means &quot;Northern
  Capital,&quot; has been the chief city of China ever since the
  Tartars were expelled, and is the residence of the Emperor. The tract
  of country on which it stands is sandy and barren; but the Grand
  Canal is well adapted for the purpose of feeding its vast population
  with the produce of more fertile provinces and districts. A very
  large portion of the centre of the part of Pekin called the Northern
  City is occupied by the Emperor with his palaces and gardens, which
  are of the most beautiful description, and, surrounded by their own
  wall, form what is called the &quot;Prohibited City.&quot;</p>
  <!-- [Illustration: GRAND CANAL AT THE ENTRANCE TO PEKIN.] -->

  <div class="illustration">
    <a name="image-0012"></a> <img src="img/0012.jpg" alt=
    "Grand Canal at the Entrance to Pekin.">
  </div>

  <p>The Grand Canal, which runs about five hundred miles, without
  allowing for windings, across the kingdom of China, is not only the
  means by which subsistence is brought to the inhabitants of the
  imperial city, but is of great value in conveying the tribute, a
  large portion of the revenue being paid in kind. Dr. Davis mentions
  having observed on it a large junk decorated with a yellow umbrella,
  and found on enquiry that it had the honour of bearing the
  &quot;Dragon robes,&quot; as the Emperor&#39;s garments are called.
  These are forwarded annually, and are the peculiar tribute of the
  silk districts. The banks of the Grand Canal are, in many parts
  through which it flows, strongly faced with stone, a precaution very
  necessary to prevent the danger of inundations, from which some parts
  of this country are constantly suffering. The Yellow River so very
  frequently overflows its banks, and brings so much peril and calamity
  to the people, that it has been called &quot;China&#39;s
  Sorrow;&quot; and the European trade at Canton has been very heavily
  taxed for the damage occasioned by it.</p>

  <p>The Grand Canal and the Yellow River, in one part of the country,
  run within four or five miles of each other, for about fifty miles;
  and at length they join or cross each other, and then run in a
  contrary direction. A great deal of ceremony is used by the crews of
  the vessels when they reach this point, and, amongst other customs,
  they stock themselves abundantly with live cocks, destined to be
  sacrificed on crossing the river. These birds annoy and trouble the
  passengers so much by their incessant crowing on the top of the
  boats, that they are not much pitied when the time for their death
  arrives. The boatmen collect money for their purchase from the
  passengers, by sending red paper petitions called <i>pin</i>, begging
  for aid to provide them with these and other needful supplies. The
  difficulties which the Chinese must have struggled against, with
  their defective science, in this junction of the canal and the river,
  are incalculable; and it is impossible to deny them the praise they
  deserve for so great an exercise of perseverance and industry.</p>

  <h2>THE GOLIAH ARATOO.</h2>

  <p>The splendid family of parrots includes about one hundred and
  sixty species, and, though peculiar to the warmer regions of the
  world, they are better known in England than any other foreign bird.
  From the beauty of their plumage, the great docility of their
  manners, and the singular faculty they possess of imitating the human
  voice, they are general favourites, both in the drawingroom of the
  wealthy and the cottage of humble life.</p>

  <p>The various species differ in size, as well as in appearance and
  colour. Some (as the macaws) are larger than the domestic fowl, and
  some of the parakeets are not larger than a blackbird or even a
  sparrow.</p>

  <p>The interesting bird of which our Engraving gives a representation
  was recently brought alive to this country by the captain of a
  South-seaman (the <i>Alert</i>), who obtained it from a Chinese
  vessel from the Island of Papua, to whom the captain of the
  <i>Alert</i> rendered valuable assistance when in a state of
  distress. In size this bird is one of the largest of the parrot
  tribe, being superior to the great red Mexican Macaw. The whole
  plumage is black, glossed with a greenish grey; the head is
  ornamented with a large crest of long pendulous feathers, which it
  erects at pleasure, when the bird has a most noble appearance; the
  orbits of the eyes and cheeks are of a deep rose-colour; the bill is
  of great size, and will crack the hardest fruit stones; but when the
  kernel is detached, the bird does not crush and swallow it in large
  fragments, but scrapes it with the lower mandible to the finest pulp,
  thus differing from other parrots in the mode of taking food. In the
  form of its tongue it differs also from other birds of the kind. A
  French naturalist read a memoir on this organ before the Academy of
  Sciences at Paris, in which he aptly compared it, in its uses, to the
  trunk of an elephant. In its manners it is gentle and familiar, and
  when approached raises a cry which may be compared to a hoarse
  croaking. In its gait it resembles the rook, and walks much better
  than most of the climbing family.</p>
  <!-- [Illustration: GOLIAH ARATOO.] -->

  <div class="illustration">
    <a name="image-0014"></a> <img src="img/0014.jpg" alt=
    "Goliah Aratoo.">
  </div>

  <p>From the general conformation of the parrots, as well as the
  arrangement and strength of their toes, they climb very easily,
  assisting themselves greatly with their hooked bill, but walk rather
  awkwardly on the ground, from the shortness and wide separation of
  their legs. The bill of the parrot is moveable in both mandibles, the
  upper being joined to the skull by a membrane which acts like a
  hinge; while in other birds the upper beak forms part of the skull.
  By this curious contrivance they can open their bills widely, which
  the hooked form of the beak would not otherwise allow them to do. The
  structure of the wings varies greatly in the different species: in
  general they are short, and as their bodies are bulky, they cannot
  consequently rise to any great height without difficulty; but when
  once they gain a certain distance they fly easily, and some of them
  with rapidity. The number of feathers in the tail is always twelve,
  and these, both in length and form, are very varied in the different
  species, some being arrow or spear-shaped, others straight and
  square.</p>

  <p>In eating, parrots make great use of the feet, which they employ
  like hands, holding the food firmly with the claws of one, while they
  support themselves on the other. From the hooked shape of their
  bills, they find it more convenient to turn their food in an outward
  direction, instead of, like monkeys and other animals, turning it
  towards their mouths.</p>

  <p>The whole tribe are fond of water, washing and bathing themselves
  many times during the day in streams and marshy places; and having
  shaken the water from their plumage, seem greatly to enjoy spreading
  their beautiful wings to dry in the sun.</p>

  <p>&#39;Tis true, said I, correcting the proposition&mdash;the
  Bastile is not an evil to be despised; but strip it of its towers,
  fill the fosse, unbarricade the doors, call it simply a confinement,
  and suppose it is some tyrant of a distemper, and not a man which
  holds you in it, the evil vanishes, and you bear the other half
  without complaint. I was interrupted in the heyday of this soliloquy,
  with a voice which I took to be of a child, which complained &quot;It
  could not get out.&quot; I looked up and down the passage, and seeing
  neither man, woman, or child, I went out without further attention.
  In my return back through the passage, I heard the same words
  repeated twice over; and looking up, I saw it was a starling, hung in
  a little cage; &quot;I can&#39;t get out, I can&#39;t get out,&quot;
  said the starling. I stood looking at the bird; and to every person
  who came through the passage, it ran fluttering to the side towards
  which they approached it with the same lamentation of its captivity.
  &quot;I can&#39;t get out,&quot; said the starling. &quot;Then I will
  let you out,&quot; said I, &quot;cost what it will;&quot; so I turned
  about the cage to get at the door&mdash;it was twisted and double
  twisted so fast with wire there was no getting it open without
  pulling the cage to pieces; I took both hands to it. The bird flew to
  the place where I was attempting his deliverance, and thrusting his
  head through the trellis, pressed his breast against it, as if
  impatient. &quot;I fear, poor creature,&quot; said I, &quot;I cannot
  set thee at liberty.&quot; &quot;No,&quot; said the starling; &quot;I

  <p>I vow, I never had my affections more tenderly awakened; nor do I
  remember an incident in my life, where the dissipated spirits to

  <p>Juggernaut is the principal idol worshipped by the Hindoos, and to
  his temple, which is at Pooree, are attached no less than four
  thousand priests and servants; of these one set are called Pundahs.
  In the autumn of the year they start on a journey through India,
  preaching in every town and village the advantages of a pilgrimage to
  Juggernaut, after which they conduct to Pooree large bodies of
  pilgrims for the Rath Justra, or Car Festival, which takes place in
  May or June. This is the principal festival, and the number of
  devotees varies from about 80,000 to 150,000. No European, Mussulman,
  or low cast Hindoo is admitted into the temple; we can therefore only
  speak from report of what goes on inside. Mr. Acland, in his manners
  and customs of India, gives us the following amusing account of this
  celebrated idol:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&quot;Juggernaut represents the ninth incarnation of Vishnoo, a
  Hindoo deity, and consists of a mere block of sacred wood, in the
  centre of which is said to be concealed a fragment of the original
  idol, which was fashioned by Vishnoo himself. The features and all
  the external parts are formed of a mixture of mud and cow-dung,
  painted. Every morning the idol undergoes his ablutions; but, as the
  paint would not stand the washing, the priests adopt a very ingenious
  plan&mdash;they hold a mirror in front of the image and wash his
  reflection. Every evening he is put to bed; but, as the idol is very
  unwieldy, they place the bedstead in front of him, and on that they
  lay a small image. Offerings are made to him by pilgrims and others,
  of rice, money, jewels, elephants, &amp;c., the Rajah of Knoudah and
  the priests being his joint treasurers. On the day of the festival,
  three cars, between fifty and sixty feet in height, are brought to
  the gate of the temple; the idols are then taken out by the priests,
  Juggernaut having golden arms and diamond eyes for that one day, and
  by means of pulleys are hauled up and placed in their respective
  carriages: to these enormous ropes are attached, and the assembled
  thousands with loud shouts proceed to drag the idols to
  Juggernaut&#39;s country-house, a small temple about a mile distant.
  This occupies several days, and the idols are then brought back to
  their regular stations. The Hindoos believe that every person who
  aids in dragging the cars receives pardon for all his past sins; but
  the fact that people throw themselves under the wheels of the cars,
  appears to have been an European conjecture, arising from the
  numerous deaths that occur from accidents at the time the immense
  cars are in progress.&quot;</p>

  </div>

  <p>These cars have an imposing air, from their great size and
  loftiness: the wheels are six feet in diameter; but every part of the
  ornament is of the meanest and most paltry description, save only the
  covering of striped and spangled broad-cloth, the splendid and
  gorgeous effect of which makes up in a great measure for other
  deficiencies.</p>

  <p>During the period the pilgrims remain at Pooree they are not
  allowed to eat anything but what has been offered to the idol, and
  that they have to buy at a high price from the priests.</p>

  <p>Cyprus, an island in the Levant, is said to have taken its name
  from the number of shrubs of that name with which it once abounded.
  From this tall shrub, the cypress, its ancient inhabitants made an
  oil of a very delicious flavour, which was an article of great
  importance in their commerce, and is still in great repute among
  Eastern nations. It once, too, abounded with forests of olive trees;
  and immense cisterns are still to be seen, which have been erected
  for the purpose of preserving the oil which the olive yielded.</p>

  <p>Near the centre of the island stands Nicotia, the capital, and the
  residence of the governor, who now occupies one of the palaces of its
  ancient sovereigns. The palaces are remarkable for the beauty of
  their architecture, but are abandoned by their Turkish masters to the
  destructive hand of time. The church of St. Sophia, in this place, is
  built in the Gothic style, and is said to have been erected by the
  Emperor Justinian. Here the Christian Kings of Cyprus were formerly
  crowned; but it is now converted into a mosque.</p>

  <p>The island was formerly divided into nine kingdoms, and was famous
  for its superb edifices, its elegant temples, and its riches, but can
  now boast of nothing but its ruins, which will tell to distant times
  the greatness from which it has fallen.</p>

  <p>The southern coast of this island is exposed to the hot winds from
  all directions. During a squall from the north-east, the temperature
  has been described as so scorching, that the skin instantly peeled
  from the lips, a tendency to sneeze was excited, accompanied with
  great pain in the eyes, and chapping of the hands and face. The heats
  are sometimes so excessive, that persons going out without an
  umbrella are liable to suffer from <i>coup de soleil</i>, or
  sun-stroke; and the inhabitants, especially of the lower class, in
  order to guard against it, wrap up their heads in a large turban,
  over which in their journeys they plait a thick shawl many times
  folded. They seldom, however, venture out of their houses during
  mid-day, and all journeys, even those of caravans, are performed in
  the night. Rains are also rare in the summer season, and long
  droughts banish vegetation, and attract numberless columns of
  locusts, which destroy the plants and fruits.</p>

  <p>The soil, though very fertile, is rarely cultivated, the Greeks
  being so oppressed by their Turkish masters that they dare not
  cultivate the rich plains which surround them, as the produce would
  be taken from them; and their whole object is to collect together
  during the year as much grain as is barely sufficient to pay their
  tax to the Governor, the omission of which is often punished by
  torture or even by death.</p>

  <p>The carob, or St. John&#39;s bread-tree, is plentiful; and the
  long thick pods which it produces are exported in considerable
  quantities to Syria and Egypt. The succulent pulp which the pod
  contains is sometimes employed in those countries instead of sugar
  and honey, and is often used in preserving other fruits. The vine
  grows here perhaps in greater perfection than in any other part of
  the world, and the wine of the island is celebrated all over the
  Levant.</p>

  <p>This terrible reptile is found in great abundance on the continent
  of America; and if its instinct induced it to make use of the
  dreadful means of destruction and self-defence which it possesses, it
  would become so great a scourge as to render the parts in which it is
  found almost uninhabitable: but, except when violently irritated, or
  for the purpose of self-preservation, it seldom employs the fatal
  power bestowed upon it. The rattlesnake inserts its poison in the
  body of its victim by means of two long sharp-pointed teeth or fangs,
  which grow one on each side of the forepart of the upper jaw. The
  construction of these teeth is very singular; they are hollow for a
  portion of their length, and in each tooth is found a narrow slit
  communicating with the central hollow; the root of the fang rests on
  a kind of bag, containing a certain quantity of a liquid poison, and
  when the animal buries his teeth in his prey, a portion of this fluid
  is forced through these openings and lodged at the bottom of the
  wound. Another peculiarity of these poison teeth is, that when not in
  use they turn back, as it were, upon a hinge, and lie flat in the
  roof of the animal&#39;s mouth.</p>

  <p>The name of rattlesnake is given to it on account of the singular
  apparatus with which the extremity of its tail is furnished. This
  consists of a series of hollow horn-like substances, placed loosely
  one behind the other in such a manner as to produce a kind of
  rattling noise when the tail is shaken; and as the animal, whenever
  it is enraged, always carries its tail raised up, and produces at the
  same time a tremulous motion in it, this provision of nature gives
  timely notice of its dangerous approach. The number of pieces of
  which this rattle is formed points out the age of the snake, which
  acquires a fresh piece every year. Some specimens have been found
  with as many as from forty to fifty, thus indicating a great age.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The poison of the Viper consists of a yellowish liquid, secreted
  in a glandular structure (situated immediately below the skin on
  either side of the head), which is believed to represent the parotid
  gland of the higher animals. If a viper be made to bite something
  solid, so as to avoid its poison, the following are the appearances
  under the microscope:&mdash;At first nothing is seen but a parcel of
  salts nimbly floating in the liquor, but in a very short time these
  saline particles shoot out into crystals of incredible tenuity and
  sharpness, with something like knots here and there, from which these
  crystals seem to proceed, so that the whole texture in a manner
  represents a spider&#39;s web, though infinitely finer and more
  minute. These spiculae, or darts, will remain unaltered on the glass
  for some months. Five or six grains of this viperine poison, mixed
  with half an ounce of human blood, received in a warm glass, produce
  no visible effects, either in colour or consistence, nor do portions
  of this poisoned blood, mixed with acids or alkalies, exhibit any
  alterations. When placed on the tongue, the taste is sharp and acrid,
  as if the tongue had been struck with something scalding or burning;
  but this sensation goes off in two or three hours. There are only
  five cases on record of death following the bite of the viper; and it
  has been observed that the effects are most virulent when the poison
  has been received on the extremities, particularly the fingers and
  toes, at which parts the animal, when irritated (as it were, by an
  innate instinct), always takes its aim.</p>

  <p>After various adventures, Thor, accompanied by Thialfi and Loke,
  his servants, entered upon Giantland, and wandered over
  plains&mdash;wild uncultivated places&mdash;among stones and trees.
  At nightfall they noticed a house; and as the door, which indeed
  formed one whole side of the house, was open, they entered. It was a
  simple habitation&mdash;one large hall, altogether empty. They stayed
  there. Suddenly, in the dead of the night, loud voices alarmed them.
  Thor grasped his hammer, and stood in the doorway, prepared for
  fight. His companions within ran hither and thither, in their terror,
  seeking some outlet in that rude hall: they found a little closet at
  last, and took refuge there. Neither had Thor any battle; for lo! in
  the morning it turned out that the noise had been only the snoring of
  a certain enormous, but peaceable, giant&mdash;the giant Skrymir, who
  lay peaceably sleeping near by; and this, that they took for a house,
  was merely his glove thrown aside there: the door was the
  glove-wrist; the little closet they had fled into was the thumb! Such
  a glove! I remark, too, that it had not fingers, as ours have, but
  only a thumb, and the rest undivided&mdash;a most ancient rustic
  glove!</p>

  <p>Skrymir now carried their portmanteau all day; Thor, however, who
  had his suspicions, did not like the ways of Skrymir, and determined
  at night to put an end to him as he slept. Raising his hammer, he
  struck down into the giant&#39;s face a right thunderbolt blow, of
  force to rend rocks. The giant merely awoke, rubbed his cheek, and
  said, &quot;Did a leaf fall?&quot; Again Thor struck, as soon as
  Skrymir again slept, a better blow than before; but the giant only
  murmured, &quot;Was that a grain of sand!&quot; Thor&#39;s third
  stroke was with both his hands (the &quot;knuckles white,&quot; I
  suppose), and it seemed to cut deep into Skrymir&#39;s visage; but he
  merely checked his snore, and remarked, &quot;There must be sparrows
  roosting in this tree, I think.&quot;</p>

  <p>At the gate of Utgard&mdash;a place so high, that you had to
  strain your neck bending back to see the top of it&mdash;Skrymir went
  his way. Thor and his companions were admitted, and invited to take a
  share in the games going on. To Thor, for his part, they handed a
  drinking-horn; it was a common feat, they told him, to drink this dry
  at one draught. Long and fiercely, three times over, Thor drank, but
  made hardly any impression. He was a weak child, they told him; could
  he lift that cat he saw there? Small as the feat seemed, Thor, with
  his whole godlike strength, could not: he bent up the creature&#39;s
  back, could not raise its feet off the ground&mdash;could at the
  utmost raise one foot. &quot;Why, you are no man,&quot; said the
  Utgard people; &quot;there is an old woman that will wrestle
  you.&quot; Thor, heartily ashamed, seized this haggard old woman, but
  could not throw her.</p><!-- [Illustration: THE GIANT SKRYMIR.] -->

    <a name="image-0024"></a> <img src="img/0024.jpg" alt=
    "The Giant Skrymir.">
  </div>

  <p>And now, on their quitting Utgard&mdash;the chief Jotun, escorting
  them politely a little way, said to Thor&mdash;&quot;You are beaten,
  then; yet, be not so much ashamed: there was deception of appearance
  in it. That horn you tried to drink was the sea; you did make it ebb:
  but who could drink that, the bottomless? The cat you would have
  lifted&mdash;why, that is the Midgard Snake, the Great World
  Serpent&mdash;which, tail in mouth, girds and keeps up the whole
  created world. Had you torn that up, the world must have rushed to
  ruin. As for the old woman, she was Time, Old Age, Duration: with her
  what can wrestle? No man, nor no god, with her. Gods or men, she
  prevails over all! And then, those three strokes you
  struck&mdash;look at these valleys&mdash;your three strokes made
  these.&quot; Thor looked at his attendant Jotun&mdash;it was Skrymir.
  It was, say old critics, the old chaotic rocky earth in person, and
  that glove house was some earth cavern! But Skrymir had vanished.
  Utgard, with its sky-high gates, when Thor raised his hammer to smite
  them, had gone to air&mdash;only the giant&#39;s voice was heard
  mocking; &quot;Better come no more to Jotunheim!&quot;</p>

  <h2>VALUE OF THE BIBLE.</h2>

  <p>What an invaluable blessing it is to have the Bible in our own
  tongue. It is not only the oldest, but the best book in the world.
  Our forefathers rejoiced when they were first favoured with the
  opportunity of reading it for themselves. Infidels may reject, and
  the licentious may sneer; but no one who ever wished to take away
  this foundation-stone, could produce any other equal to it, on which
  the structure of a pious mind, a solid hope, a comfortable state, or
  wise conduct, could be raised. We are told, that when Archbishop
  Crammer&#39;s edition of the Bible was printed in 1538, and fixed to
  a desk in all parochial churches, the ardour with which men flocked
  to read it was incredible. They who could, procured it; and they who
  could not, crowded to read it, or to hear it read in churches. It was
  common to see little assemblies of mechanics meeting together for
  that purpose after the labour of the day. Many even learned to read
  in their old age, that they might have the pleasure of instructing
  themselves from the Scriptures.</p>

  <p>It is recorded of Edward VI., that upon a certain occasion, a
  paper which was called for in the council-chamber happened to be out
  of reach; the person concerned to produce it took a Bible that lay
  near, and, standing upon it, reached down the paper. The King,
  observing what was done, ran to the place, and taking the Bible in
  his hands kissed it, and laid it up again. This circumstance, though
  trifling in itself, showed his Majesty&#39;s great reverence for that
  <i>best of all books</i>; and his example is a striking reproof to
  those who suffer their Bibles to lie covered with dust for months
  together, or who throw them about as if they were only a piece of
  useless lumber.</p>

  <p>During the retreat of the famous King Alfred at Athelney, in
  Somersetshire, after the defeat of his forces by the Danes, the
  following circumstance happened, which shows the extremities to which
  that great man was reduced, and gives a striking proof of his pious
  and benevolent disposition:&mdash;A beggar came to his little castle,
  and requested alms. His Queen informed him that they had only one
  small loaf remaining, which was insufficient for themselves and their
  friends, who were gone abroad in quest of food, though with little
  hopes of success. But the King replied, &quot;Give the poor Christian
  the one half of the loaf. He that could feed live thousand with five
  loaves and two fishes, can certainly make that half of the loaf
  suffice for more than our necessities.&quot; Accordingly the poor man
  was relieved; and this noble act of charity was soon recompensed by a
  providential store of fresh provisions, with which his people
  returned.</p>

  <p>Sir Philip Sydney, at the battle near Zutphen, displayed the most
  undaunted courage. He had two horses killed under him; and, whilst
  mounting a third, was wounded by a musket-shot out of the trenches,
  which broke the bone of his thigh. He returned about mile and a half
  on horseback to the camp; and being faint with the loss of blood, and
  parched with thirst from the heat of the weather, he called for
  drink. It was presently brought him; but, as he was putting the
  vessel to his mouth, a poor wounded soldier, who happened to be
  carried along at that instant, looked up to it with wistful eyes. The
  gallant and generous Sydney took the flagon from his lips, just when
  he was going to drink, and delivered it to the soldier, saying,
  &quot;Thy necessity is greater than mine.&quot;</p>

  <p>Frederick, King of Prussia, one day rang his bell and nobody
  answered; on which he opened the door and found his page fast asleep
  in an elbow-chair. He advanced toward him, and was going to awaken,
  him, when he perceived a letter hanging out of his pocket. His
  curiosity prompting him to know what it was, he took it out and read
  it. It was a letter from the young man&#39;s mother, in which she
  thanked him for having sent her part of his wages to relieve her in
  her misery, and finished with telling; him that God would reward him
  for his dutiful affection. The King, after having read it, went back
  softly into his chamber, took a bag full of ducats, and slipped it
  with the letter into the page&#39;s pocket. Returning to his chamber,
  he rang the bell so violently that he awakened the page, who
  instantly made his appearance. &quot;You have had a sound
  sleep,&quot; said the King. The page was at a loss how to excuse
  himself and, putting his hand into his pocket by chance, to his utter
  astonishment he there found a purse of ducats. He took it out, turned
  pale, and looking at the bag, burst into tears without being able to
  utter a single word. &quot;What is that?&quot; said the King;
  &quot;what is the matter?&quot; &quot;Ah, sire!&quot; said the young
  man, throwing himself on his knees, &quot;somebody seeks my ruin! I
  know nothing of this money which I have just found in my
  pocket!&quot; &quot;My young friend,&quot; replied Frederick,
  &quot;God often does great things for us even in our sleep. Send that
  to your mother, salute her on my part, and assure her that I will
  take care of both her and you.&quot;</p>

  <h2>THE SPANIELS OF THE MONKS OF ST. BERNARD.</h2>

  <p>The convent of the Great St. Bernard is situated near the top of
  the mountain known by that name, near one of the most dangerous
  passes of the Alps, between Switzerland and Savoy. In these regions
  the traveller is often overtaken by the most severe weather, even
  after days of cloudless beauty, when the glaciers glitter in the
  sunshine, and the pink flowers of the rhododendron appear as if they
  were never to be sullied by the tempest. But a storm suddenly comes
  on; the roads are rendered impassable by drifts of snow; the
  avalanches, which are huge loosened masses of snow or ice, are swept
  into the valleys, carrying trees and crags of rock before them.</p>
  <!-- [Illustration: CONVENT OF MONT ST. BERNARD.] -->

  </div>

  <p>The hospitable monks, though their revenue is scanty, open their
  doors to every stranger that presents himself. To be cold, to be
  weary, to be benighted, constitutes the title to their comfortable
  shelter, their cheering meal, and their agreeable converse. But their
  attention to the dis tressed does not end here. They devote
  themselves to the dangerous task of searching for those unhappy
  persons who may have been overtaken by the sudden storm, and would
  perish but for their charitable succour. Most remarkably are they
  assisted in these truly Christian offices. They have a breed of noble
  dogs in their establishment, whose extraordinary sagacity often
  enables them to rescue the traveller from destruction. Benumbed with
  cold, weary in the search of a lost track, his senses yielding to the
  stupefying influence of frost, the unhappy man sinks upon the ground,
  and the snow-drift covers him from human sight. It is then that the
  keen scent and the exquisite docility of these admirable dogs are
  called into action. Though the perishing man lie ten or even twenty
  feet beneath the snow, the delicacy of smell with which they can
  trace him offers a chance of escape. They scratch away the snow with
  their feet; they set up a continued hoarse and solemn bark, which
  brings the monks and labourers of the convent to their
  assistance.</p>

  <p>To provide for the chance that the dogs, without human help, may
  succeed in discovering the unfortunate traveller, one of them has a
  flask of spirits round his neck, to which the fainting man may apply
  for support; and another has a cloak to cover him. Their wonderful
  exertions are often successful; and even where they fail of restoring
  him who has perished, the dogs discover the body, so that it may be
  secured for the recognition of friends; and such is the effect of the
  cold, that the dead features generally preserve their firmness for
  the space of two years. One of these noble creatures was decorated
  with a medal, in commemoration of his having saved the lives of
  twenty-two persons, who, but for his sagacity, must have perished.
  Many travellers, who have crossed the pass of St. Bernard, have seen
  this dog, and have heard, around the blazing fire of the monks, the
  story of his extraordinary career. He perished about the year 1816,
  in an attempt to convey a poor traveller to his anxious family.</p>

  <h2>JOPPA.</h2>

  <p>Joppa is the principal sea-port town of Palestine and it is very
  often mentioned in Scripture.</p>

  <p>Hiram, King of Tyre, is said to have sent cedars of Lebanon by sea
  to Joppa, for the building of Solomon&#39;s Temple; and from Joppa
  the disobedient Jonah embarked, when ordered by God to go and preach
  to the people of Nineveh.</p>

  <p>It was at Joppa that the apostle Peter lived, for some time, with
  one Simon, a tanner, whose house was by the sea-shore; and it was on
  the flat roof of this dwelling that he saw the wonderful vision,
  which taught him not to call any man common or unclean.</p>
  <!-- [Illustration: JOPPA.] -->

  <div class="illustration">
    <a name="image-0030"></a> <img src="img/0030.jpg" alt="Joppa.">
  </div>

  <p>Tabitha or Dorcas, the pious woman who spent all her life in
  working for the poor, and in giving alms to those who needed relief,
  lived in Joppa; and here it pleased God that she should be taken ill
  and die, and her body was laid out in the usual manner before burial,
  in an upper chamber of the house where she lived. The apostle Peter,
  to whom this pious woman had been well known, was then at Lydda, not
  far from Joppa, and the disciples sent to tell him of the heavy loss
  the Church had met with in the death of Dorcas, and begged that he
  would come and comfort them. The apostle directly left Lydda and went
  over to Joppa. He was, by his own desire, taken to the room where the
  corpse lay, and was much moved when he saw the tears of the poor
  women who had been fed and clothed by the charity of Dorcas, and who
  were telling each other how much good she had been the means of doing
  them.</p>

  <p>Peter desired to be left alone with the body, and then he knelt
  down and prayed, and, receiving strength from God, he turned to the
  body and cried, &quot;Tabitha, arise!&quot; She then, like one
  awaking from sleep, opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter she sat
  up. He then took her by the hand, and she arose and was presented
  alive to those who, thinking she was dead, had so lately been
  mourning for her loss. This was the first miracle performed by the
  apostles, and it greatly surprised the people of Joppa, who began one
  and all to believe that Peter was really a preacher sent by God.</p>

  <p>The name of Joppa signified beautiful. It was built upon the side
  of a rocky mountain, which rises from the sea-shore, and all around
  it were lovely gardens, full of vines, figs, and other fruits.</p>

  <p><a name="THE_AMERICAN_TAPIR"></a></p>
  <hr class="long">

  <h2>THE AMERICAN TAPIR.</h2>

  <p>There are but three known species of the Tapir, two of
  which&mdash;the Peccary and the Tapir&mdash;are natives of South
  America, the other of Sumatra and Malacca. Its anatomy is much like
  that of the rhinoceros, while in general form the tapir reminds us of
  the hog. It is a massive and powerful animal, and its fondness for
  the water is almost as strong as that displayed by the hippopotamus.
  It swims and dives admirably, and will remain submerged for many
  minutes, rising to the surface for breath, and then again plunging
  in. When hunted or wounded, it always, if possible, makes for the
  water; and in its nightly wanderings will traverse rivers and lakes
  in search of food, or for pleasure. The female is very attentive to
  her young one, leading it about on the land, and accustoming it at an
  early period to enter the water, where it plunges and plays before
  its parent, who seems to act as its instructress, the male taking no
  share in the work.</p>

  <p>The tapir is very common in the warm regions of South America,
  where it inhabits the forests, leading a solitary life, and seldom
  stirring from its retreat during the day, which it passes in a state
  of tranquil slumber. During the night, its season of activity, it
  wanders forth in search of food, which consists of water-melons,
  gourds, young shoots of brushwood, &amp;c.; but, like the hog, it is
  not very particular in its diet. Its senses of smell and hearing are
  extremely acute, and serve to give timely notice of the approach of
  enemies. Defended by its tough thick hide, it is capable of forcing
  its way through the thick underwood in any direction it pleases: when
  thus driving onwards, it carries its head low, and, as it were,
  ploughs its course.</p>

  <p>The most formidable enemy of this animal, if we except man, is the
  jaguar; and it is asserted that when that tiger of the American
  forest throws itself upon the tapir, the latter rushes through the
  most dense and tangled underwood, bruising its enemy, and generally
  succeeds in dislodging him.</p>

  <p>The snout of the tapir greatly reminds one of the trunk of the
  elephant; for although it is not so long, it is very flexible, and
  the animal makes excellent use of it as a crook to draw down twigs to
  the mouth, or grasp fruit or bunches of herbage: it has nostrils at
  the extremity, but there is no finger-like appendage.</p>

  <p>In its disposition the tapir is peaceful and quiet, and, unless
  hard pressed, never attempts to attack either man or beast; when,
  however, the hunter&#39;s dogs surround it, it defends itself very
  vigorously with its teeth, inflicting terrible wounds, and uttering a
  cry like a shrill kind of whistle, which is in strange contrast with
  the massive bulk of the animal.</p>
  <!-- [Illustration: AMERICAN TAPIR.] -->

  <div class="illustration">
    <a name="image-0032"></a> <img src="img/0032.jpg" alt=
    "American Tapir.">
  </div>

  <p>The Indian tapir greatly resembles its American relative; it feeds
  on vegetables, and is very partial to the sugar-cane. It is larger
  than the American, and the snout is longer and more like the trunk of
  the elephant. The most striking difference, however, between the
  eastern and western animal is in colour. Instead of being the uniform
  dusky-bay tint of the American, the Indian is strangely
  particoloured. The head, neck, fore-limbs, and fore-quarters are
  quite black; the body then becomes suddenly white or greyish-white,
  and so continues to about half-way over the hind-quarters, when the
  black again commences abruptly, spreading over the legs. The animal,
  in fact, looks just as if it were covered round the body with a white
  horse-cloth.</p>

  <p>Though the flesh of both the Indian and American tapir is dry and
  disagreeable as an article of food, still the animal might be
  domesticated with advantage, and employed as a beast of burthen, its
  docility and great strength being strong recommendations.</p>

  <hr class="long">

  <h2>THE FIELD OF WATERLOO.</h2>

  <p>Waterloo is a considerable village of Belgium, containing about
  1600 inhabitants; and the Field of Waterloo, so celebrated as the
  scene of the battle between two of the greatest generals who ever
  lived, is about two miles from it. It was very far from a strong
  position to be chosen for this purpose, but, no doubt, was the best
  the country afforded. A gently rising ground, not steep enough in any
  part to prevent a rush of infantry at double-quick time, except in
  the dell on the left of the road, near the farm of La Haye Sainte;
  and along the crest of the hill a scrubby hedge and low bank fencing
  a narrow country road. This was all, except La Haye Sainte and
  Hougoumont. This <i>chateau</i>, or country-seat, one of those
  continental residences which unite in them something of the nature of
  a castle and a farm-house, was the residence of a Belgic gentleman.
  It stands on a little eminence near the main road leading from
  Brussels to Nivelles. The buildings consisted of an old tower and a
  chapel, and a number of offices, partly surrounded by a farm-yard.
  The garden was enclosed by a high and strong wall; round the garden
  was a wood or orchard, which was enclosed by a thick hedge,
  concealing the wall. The position of the place was deemed so
  important by the Duke of Wellington, that he took possession of the
  Ch&acirc;teau of Goumont, as it was called, on the 17th of June, and
  the troops were soon busily preparing for the approaching contest, by
  perforating the walls, making loop-holes for the fire of the
  musketry, and erecting scaffolding for the purpose of firing from the
  top.</p>

  <p>The importance of this place was also so well appreciated by
  Bonaparte, that the battle of the 18th began by his attacking
  Hougoumont. This name, which was bestowed upon it by the mistake of
  our great commander, has quite superseded the real one of
  Ch&acirc;teau Goumont. The ruins are among the most interesting of
  all the points connected with this memorable place, for the struggle
  there was perhaps the fiercest. The battered walls, the dismantled
  and fire-stained chapel, which remained standing through all the
  attack, still may be seen among the wreck of its once beautiful
  garden; while huge blackened beams, which have fallen upon the
  crumbling heaps of stone and plaster, are lying in all
  directions.</p>

  <p>On the field of battle are two interesting monuments: one, to the
  memory of the Hon. Sir Alexander Gordon, brother to the Earl of
  Aberdeen, who there terminated a short but glorious career, at the
  age of twenty-nine, and &quot;fell in the blaze of his fame;&quot;
  the other, to some brave officers of the German Legion, who likewise
  died under circumstances of peculiar distinction. There is also, on
  an enormous mound, a colossal lion of bronze, erected by the Belgians
  to the honour of the Prince of Orange, who was wounded at, or near,
  to the spot.</p>

  <p>Against the walls of the church of the village of Waterloo are
  many beautiful marble tablets, with the most affecting inscriptions,
  records of men of various countries, who expired on that solemn and
  memorable occasion in supporting a common cause. Many of these brave
  men were buried in a cemetery at a short distance from the
  village.</p><!-- [Illustration: FIELD OF WATERLOO] -->

  <h2>NAPOLEON.</h2>

  <p>With his passions, and in spite of his errors, Napoleon was,
  taking him all in all, the greatest warrior of modern times. He
  carried into battle a stoical courage, a profoundly calculated
  tenacity, a mind fertile in sudden inspirations, which, by
  unlooked-for resources, disconcerted the plans of his enemy. Let us
  beware of attributing a long series of success to the organic power
  of the masses which he set in motion. The most experienced eye could
  scarcely discover in them any thing but elements of disorder. Still
  less, let it be said, that he was a successful captain because he was
  a mighty Monarch. Of all his campaigns, the most memorable are the
  campaign of the Adige, where the general of yesterday, commanding an
  army by no means numerous, and at first badly appointed, placed
  himself at once above Turenne, and on a level with Frederick; and the
  campaign in France in 1814, when, reduced to a handful of harrassed
  troops, he combated a force of ten times their number. The last
  flashes of Imperial lightning still dazzled the eyes of our enemies;
  and it was a fine sight to see the bounds of the old lion, tracked,
  hunted down, beset&mdash;presenting a lively picture of the days of
  his youth, when his powers developed themselves in the fields of
  carnage.</p>

  <p>Napoleon possessed, in an eminent degree, the faculties requisite
  for the profession of arms; temperate and robust; watching and
  sleeping at pleasure; appearing unawares where he was least expected:
  he did not disregard details, to which important results are
  sometimes attached. The hand which had just traced rules for the
  government of many millions of men, would frequently rectify an
  incorrect statement of the situation of a regiment, or write down
  whence two hundred conscripts were to be obtained, and from what
  magazine their shoes were to be taken. A patient, and an easy
  interlocutor, he was a home questioner, and he could listen&mdash;a
  rare talent in the grandees of the earth. He carried with him into
  battle a cool and impassable courage. Never was mind so deeply
  meditative, more fertile in rapid and sudden illuminations. On
  becoming Emperor he ceased not to be the soldier. If his activity
  decreased with the progress of age, that was owing to the decrease of
  his physical powers. In games of mingled calculation and hazard the
  greater the advantages which a man seeks to obtain the greater risks
  he must run. It is precisely this that renders the deceitful science
  of conquerors so calamitous to nations.</p>

  <p>Napoleon, though naturally adventurous, was not deficient in
  consistency or method; and he wasted neither his soldiers nor his
  treasures where the authority of his name sufficed. What he could
  obtain by negotiations or by artifice, he required not by force of
  arms. The sword, although drawn from the scabbard, was not stained
  with blood unless it was impossible to attain the end in view by a
  manoeuvre. Always ready to fight, he chose habitually the occasion
  and the ground: out of fifty battles which he fought, he was the
  assailant in at least forty. Other generals have equalled him in the
  art of disposing troops on the ground; some have given battle as well
  as he did&mdash;we could mention several who have received it better;
  but in the manner of directing an offensive campaign he has surpassed
  all. The wars in Spain and Russia prove nothing in disparagement of
  his genius. It is not by the rules of Montecuculi and Turenne,
  manoeuvring on the Renchen, that we ought to judge of such
  enterprises: the first warred to such or such winter quarters; the
  other to subdue the world. It frequently behoved him not merely to
  gain a battle, but to gain it in such a manner as to astound Europe
  and to produce gigantic results. Thus political views were
  incessantly interfering with the strategic genius; and to appreciate
  him properly, we must not confine ourselves within the limits of the
  art of war. This art is not composed exclusively of technical
  details; it has also its philosophy.</p>

  <p>To find in this elevated region a rival of Napoleon, we must go
  back to the times when the feudal institutions had not yet broken the
  unity of the ancient nations. The founders of religion alone have
  exercised over their disciples an authority comparable with that
  which made him the absolute master of his army. This moral power
  became fatal to him, because he strove to avail himself of it even
  against the ascendancy of material force, and because it led him to
  despise positive rules, the long violation of which will not remain
  unpunished. When pride was bringing Napoleon towards his fall, he
  happened to say, &quot;France has more need of me than I have of
  France.&quot; He spoke the truth: but why had he become necessary?
  Because he had committed the destiny of France to the chances of an
  interminable war: because, in spite of the resources of his genius,
  that war, rendered daily more hazardous by his staking the whole of
  his force and by the boldness of his movements, risked, in every
  campaign, in every battle, the fruits of twenty years of triumph:
  because his government was so modelled that with him every thing must
  be swept away, and that a reaction, proportioned to the violence of
  the action, must burst forth at once both within and without. But
  Napoleon saw, without illusion, to the bottom of things. The nation,
  wholly occupied in prosecuting the designs of its chief, had
  previously not had time to form any plans for itself. The day on
  which it should have ceased to be stunned by the din of arms, it
  would have called itself to account for its servile obedience. It is
  better, thought he, for an absolute prince to fight foreign armies
  than to have to struggle against the energy of the citizens.
  Despotism had been organized for making war; war was continued to
  uphold despotism. The die was cast&mdash;France must either conquer
  Europe, or Europe subdue France. Napoleon fell&mdash;he fell, because
  with the men of the nineteenth century he attempted the work of an
  Attila and a Genghis Khan; because he gave the reins to an
  imagination directly contrary to the spirit of his age; with which,
  nevertheless, his reason was perfectly acquainted; because he would
  not pause on the day when he felt conscious of his inability to
  succeed. Nature has fixed a boundary, beyond which extravagant
  enterprises cannot be carried with prudence. This boundary the
  Emperor reached in Spain, and overleaped in Russia. Had he then
  escaped destruction, his inflexible presumption would have caused him
  to find elsewhere a Bayleu and a Moscow.</p>

  <p>Is that a rookery, papa?</p>

  <p><span class="speaker">Mr. S.</span> It is. Do you hear what a
  cawing the birds make?</p>

  <p><span class="speaker">F</span>. Yes; and I see them hopping about
  among the boughs. Pray, are not rooks the same with crows?</p>

  <p><span class="speaker">Mr. S.</span> They are a species of crow.
  But they differ from the carrion crow and raven, in not feeding upon
  dead flesh, but upon corn and other seeds and grass, though, indeed,
  they pick up beetles and other insects and worms. See what a number
  of them have alighted on yonder ploughed field, almost blackening it
  over. They are searching for grubs and worms. The men in the field do
  not molest them, for they do a great deal of service by destroying
  grubs, which, if suffered to grow to winged insects, would injure the
  trees and plants.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker">F</span>. Do all rooks live in
  rookeries?</p>

  <p><span class="speaker">Mr. S.</span> It is their nature to
  associate together, and they build in numbers of the same, or
  adjoining trees. They have no objection to the neighbourhood of man,
  but readily take to a plantation of tall trees, though it be close to
  a house; and this is commonly called a rookery. They will even fix
  their habitations on trees in the midst of towns.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker">F</span>. I think a rookery is a sort of
  town itself.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker">Mr. S.</span> It is&mdash;a village in the
  air, peopled with numerous inhabitants; and nothing can be more
  amusing than to view them all in motion, flying to and fro, and
  busied in their several occupations. The spring is their busiest
  time. Early in the year they begin to repair their nests, or build
  new ones.</p><!-- [Illustration: CROW.] -->

  <div class="illustration">
    <a name="image-0044"></a> <img src="img/0044.jpg" alt="Crow.">
  </div>

  <p><span class="speaker">F</span>. Do they all work together, or
  every one for itself?</p>

  <p><span class="speaker">Mr. S.</span> Each pair, after they have
  coupled, builds its own nest; and, instead of helping, they are very
  apt to steal the materials from one another. If both birds go out at
  once in search of sticks, they often find at their return the work
  all destroyed, and the materials carried off. However, I have met
  with a story which shows that they are not without some sense of the
  criminality of thieving. There was in a rookery a lazy pair of rooks,
  who never went out to get sticks for themselves, but made a practice
  of watching when their neighbours were abroad, and helping themselves
  from their nests. They had served most of the community in this
  manner, and by these means had just finished their own nest; when all
  the other rooks, in a rage, fell upon them at once, pulled their nest
  in pieces, beat them soundly, and drove them from their society.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker">F</span>. But why do they live together, if
  they do not help one another?</p>

  <p><span class="speaker">Mr. S.</span> They probably receive pleasure
  from the company of their own kind, as men and various other
  creatures do. Then, though they do not assist one another in
  building, they are mutually serviceable in many ways. If a large bird
  of prey hovers about a rookery for the purpose of carrying away the
  young ones, they all unite to drive him away. And when they are
  feeding in a flock, several are placed as sentinels upon the trees
  all round, to give the alarm if any danger approaches.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker">F</span>. Do rooks always keep to the same
  trees?</p>

  <p><span class="speaker">Mr. S.</span> Yes; they are much attached to
  them, and when the trees happen to be cut down, they seem greatly
  distressed, and keep hovering about them as they are falling, and
  will scarcely desert them when they lie on the ground.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker">F</span>. I suppose they feel as we should
  if our town was burned down, or overthrown by an earthquake.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker">Mr. S.</span> No doubt. The societies of
  animals greatly resemble those of men; and that of rooks is like
  those of men in the savage state, such as the communities of the
  North American Indians. It is a sort of league for mutual aid and
  defence, but in which every one is left to do as he pleases, without
  any obligation to employ himself for the whole body. Others unite in
  a manner resembling more civilised societies of men. This is the case
  with the heavers. They perform great public works by the united
  efforts of the whole community&mdash;such as damming up streams and
  constructing mounds for their habitations. As these are works of
  great art and labour, some of them probably act under the direction
  of others, and are compelled to work, whether they will or not. Many
  curious stories are told to this purpose by those who have observed
  them in their remotest haunts, where they exercise their full
  sagacity.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker">F</span>. But are they all true?</p>

  <p><span class="speaker">Mr. S.</span> That is more than I can answer
  for; yet what we certainly know of the economy of bees may justify us
  in believing extraordinary things of the sagacity of animals. The
  society of bees goes further than that of beavers, and in some
  respects beyond most among men themselves. They not only inhabit a
  common dwelling, and perform great works in common, but they lay up a
  store of provision, which is the property of the whole community, and
  is not used except at certain seasons and under certain regulations.
  A bee-hive is a true image of a commonwealth, where no member acts
  for himself alone, but for the whole body.</p>

  <h2>PALMS.</h2>

  <p>These beautiful trees may be ranked among the noblest specimens of
  vegetation; and their tall, slender, unbranched stems, crowned by
  elegant feathery foliage, composed of a cluster of gigantic leaves,
  render them, although of several varieties, different in appearance
  from all other trees. In some kinds of palm the stem is irregularly
  thick; in others, slender as a reed. It is scaly in one species, and
  prickly in another. In the <i>Palma real</i>, in Cuba, the stem
  swells out like a spindle in the middle. At the summit of these
  stems, which in some cases attain an altitude of upwards of 180 feet,
  a crown of leaves, either feathery or fan-shaped (for there is not a
  great variety in their general form), spreads out on all sides, the
  leaves being frequently from twelve to fifteen feet in length. In
  some species the foliage is of a dark green and shining surface, like
  that of a laurel or holly; in others, silvery on the under-side, as
  in the willow; and there is one species of palm with a fan-shaped
  leaf, adorned with concentric blue and yellow rings, like the
  &quot;eyes&quot; of a peacock&#39;s tail.</p>

    "Palms of Arimathea.">
  </div>

  <p>The flowers of most of the palms are as beautiful as the trees.
  Those of the <i>Palma real</i> are of a brilliant white, rendering
  them visible from a great distance; but, generally, the blossoms are
  of a pale yellow. To these succeed very different forms of fruit: in
  one species it consists of a cluster of egg-shaped berries, sometimes
  seventy or eighty in number, of a brilliant purple and gold colour,
  which form a wholesome food.</p>

  <p>South America contains the finest specimens, as well as the most
  numerous varieties of palm: in Asia the tree is not very common; and
  of the African palms but little is yet known, with the exception of
  the date palm, the most important to man of the whole tribe, though
  far less beautiful than the other species.</p>

  <p>Newfoundland Dogs are employed in drawing sledges laden with fish,
  wood, and other articles, and from their strength and docility are of
  considerable importance. The courage, devotion, and skill of this
  noble animal in the rescue of persons from drowning is well known;
  and on the banks of the Seine, at Paris, these qualities have been
  applied to a singular purpose. Ten Newfoundland dogs are there
  trained to act as servants to the Humane Society; and the rapidity
  with which they cross and re-cross the river, and come and go, at the
  voice of their trainer, is described as being most interesting to
  witness. Handsome kennels have been erected for their dwellings on
  the bridges.</p>

  <h3>DALMATIAN DOG.</h3>

  <p>There is a breed of very handsome dogs called by this name, of a
  white colour, thickly spotted with black: it is classed among the
  hounds. This species is said to have been brought from India, and is
  not remarkable for either fine scent or intelligence. The Dalmatian
  Dog is generally kept in our country as an appendage to the carriage,
  and is bred up in the stable with the horses; it consequently seldom
  receives that kind of training which is calculated to call forth any
  good qualities it may possess.</p>

  <h2>TERRIER.</h2>

  <p>The Terrier is a valuable dog in the house and farm, keeping both
  domains free from intruders, either in the shape of thieves or
  vermin. The mischief effected by rats is almost incredible; it has
  been said that, in some cases, in the article of corn, these little
  animals consume a quantity in food equal in value to the rent of the
  farm. Here the terrier is a most valuable assistant, in helping the
  farmer to rid himself of his enemies. The Scotch Terrier is very
  common in the greater part of the Western Islands of Scotland, and
  some of the species are greatly admired. Her Majesty Queen Victoria
  possesses one from Islay&mdash;a faithful, affectionate creature, yet
  with all the spirit and determination that belong to his breed.</p>

  <h2>THE GREYHOUND.</h2>

  <p>The modern smooth-haired Greyhound of England is a very elegant
  dog, not surpassed in speed and endurance by that of any other
  country. Hunting the deer with a kind of greyhound of a larger size
  was formerly a favourite diversion; and Queen Elizabeth was gratified
  by seeing, on one occasion, from a turret, sixteen deer pulled down
  by greyhounds upon the lawn at Cowdry Park, in Sussex.</p>

  <h2>OLD ENGLISH HOUND.</h2>

  <p>The dog we now call the Staghound appears to answer better than
  any other to the description given to us of the old English Hound,
  which was so much valued when the country was less enclosed, and the
  numerous and extensive forests were the harbours of the wild deer.
  This hound, with the harrier, were for many centuries the only
  hunting dogs.</p>

  <h2>SHEPHERD&#39;S DOG.</h2>

  <p>Instinct and education combine to fit this dog for our service:
  the pointer will act without any great degree of instruction, and the
  setter will crouch; but the Sheep Dog, especially if he has the
  example of an older one, will, almost without the teaching of his
  master, become everything he could wish, and be obedient to every
  order, even to the slightest motion of the hand. If the &#39;s dog be
  but with his master, he appears to be perfectly content, rarely
  mingling with his kind, and generally shunning the advances of
  strangers; but the moment duty calls, his eye brightens, he springs
  up with eagerness, and exhibits a sagacity, fidelity, and devotion
  rarely equalled even by man himself.</p>

  <h2>BULL-DOG.</h2>

  <p>Of all dogs, none surpass in obstinacy and ferocity the Bull-dog.
  The head is broad and thick, the lower jaw generally projects so that
  the under teeth advance beyond the upper, the eyes are scowling, and
  the whole expression calculated to inspire terror. It is remarkable
  for the pertinacity with which it maintains its hold of any animal it
  may have seized, and is, therefore, much used in the barbarous
  practice of bull-baiting, so common in some countries, and but lately
  abolished in England.</p>

  <p>In those prescient views by which the genius of Lord Bacon has
  often anticipated the institutions and the discoveries of succeeding
  times, there was one important object which even his foresight does
  not appear to have contemplated. Lord Bacon did not foresee that the
  English language would one day be capable of embalming all that
  philosophy can discover, or poetry can invent; that his country would
  at length possess a national literature of its own, and that it would
  exult in classical compositions, which might be appreciated with the
  finest models of antiquity. His taste was far unequal to his
  invention. So little did he esteem the language of his country, that
  his favourite works were composed in Latin; and he was anxious to
  have what he had written in English preserved in that &quot;universal
  language which may last as long as books last.&quot;</p>

  <p>It would have surprised Bacon to have been told that the most
  learned men in Europe have studied English authors to learn to think
  and to write. Our philosopher was surely somewhat mortified, when, in
  his dedication of the Essays, he observed, that, &quot;Of all my
  other works, my Essays have been most current; for that, as it seems,
  they come home to men&#39;s business and bosoms.&quot; It is too much
  to hope to find in a vast and profound inventor, a writer also who
  bestows immortality on his language. The English language is the only
  object, in his great survey of art and of nature, which owes nothing
  of its excellence to the genius of Bacon.</p>

  <p>He had reason, indeed, to be mortified at the reception of his
  philosophical works; and Dr. Rowley, even, some years after the death
  of his illustrious master, had occasion to observe, &quot;His fame is
  greater, and sounds louder in foreign parts abroad than at home in
  his own nation; thereby verifying that Divine sentence, &#39;A
  Prophet is not without honour, save in his own country and in his own
  house,&#39;&quot; Even the men of genius, who ought to have
  comprehended this new source of knowledge thus opened to them,
  reluctantly entered into it: so repugnant are we to give up ancient
  errors, which time and habit have made a part of ourselves.</p>

  <p>The earliest and one of the most fatal eruptions of Mount Vesuvius
  that is mentioned in history took place in the year 79, during the
  reign of the Emperor Titus. All Campagna was filled with
  consternation, and the country was overwhelmed with devastation in
  every direction; towns, villages, palaces, and their inhabitants were
  consumed by molten lava, and hidden from the sight by showers of
  volcanic stones, cinders, and ashes.</p>

  <p>Pompeii had suffered severely from an earthquake sixteen years
  before, but had been rebuilt and adorned with many a stately
  building, particularly a magnificent theatre, where thousands were
  assembled to see the gladiators when this tremendous visitation burst
  upon the devoted city, and buried it to a considerable depth with the
  fiery materials thrown from the crater. &quot;Day was turned to
  night,&quot; says a classic author, &quot;and night into darkness; an
  inexpressible quantity of dust and ashes was poured out, deluging
  land, sea, and air, and burying two entire cities, Pompeii and
  Herculaneum, whilst the people were sitting in the theatre.&quot;</p>

  <p>Many parts of Pompeii have, at various times, been excavated, so
  as to allow visitors to examine the houses and streets; and in
  February, 1846, the house of the Hunter was finally cleared, as it
  appears in the Engraving. This is an interesting dwelling, and was
  very likely the residence of a man of wealth, fond of the chase. A
  painting on the right occupies one side of the large room, and here
  are represented wild animals, the lion chasing a bull, &amp;c. The
  upper part of the house is raised, where stands a gaily-painted
  column&mdash;red and yellow in festoons; behind which, and over a
  doorway, is a fresco painting of a summer-house perhaps a
  representation of some country-seat of the proprietor, on either side
  are hunting-horns. The most beautiful painting in this room
  represents a Vulcan at his forge, assisted by three dusky, aged
  figures. In the niche of the outward room a small statue was found,
  in <i>terra cotta</i> (baked clay). The architecture of this house is
  singularly rich in decoration, and the paintings, particularly those
  of the birds and vases, very bright vivid.</p>

  <p>At this time, too, some very perfect skeletons were discovered in
  a house near the theatre, and near the hand of one of them were found
  thirty-seven pieces of silver and two gold coins; some of the former
  were attached to the handle of a key. The unhappy beings who were
  perished may have been the inmates of the dwelling. We know, from the
  account written by Pliny, that the young and active had plenty of
  time for escape, and this is the reason why so few skeletons have
  been found in Pompeii.</p>

  <p>In a place excavated at the expense of the Empress of Russia was
  found a portable kitchen (represented above), made of iron, with two
  round holes for boiling pots. The tabular top received the fire for
  placing other utensils upon, and by a handle in the front it could be
  moved when necessary.</p>

  <h2>THE INVISIBLE WORLD REVEALED BY THE MICROSCOPE.</h2>

  <p>A fact not less startling than would be the realisation of the
  imaginings of Shakespeare and of Milton, or of the speculations of
  Locke and of Bacon, admits of easy demonstration, namely, that the
  air, the earth, and the waters teem with numberless myriads of
  creatures, which are as unknown and as unapproachable to the great
  mass of mankind, as are the inhabitants of another planet. It may,
  indeed, be questioned, whether, if the telescope could bring within
  the reach of our observation the living things that dwell in the
  worlds around us, life would be there displayed in forms more
  diversified, in organisms more marvellous, under conditions more
  unlike those in which animal existence appears to our unassisted
  senses, than may be discovered in the leaves of every forest, in the
  flowers of every garden, and in the waters of every rivulet, by that
  noblest instrument of natural philosophy, the Microscope.</p>

  <p>To an intelligent person, who has previously obtained a general
  idea of the nature of the Objects about to be submitted to his
  inspection, a group of living animalcules, seen under a powerful
  microscope for the first time, presents a scene of extraordinary
  interest, and never fails to call forth an expression of amazement
  and admiration. This statement admits of an easy illustration: for
  example, from some water containing aquatic plants, collected from a
  pond on Clapham Common, I select a small twig, to which are attached
  a few delicate flakes, apparently of slime or jelly; some minute
  fibres, standing erect here and there on the twig, are also dimly
  visible to the naked eye. This twig, with a drop or two of the water,
  we will put between two thin plates of glass, and place under the
  field of view of a microscope, having lenses that magnify the image
  of an object 200 times in linear dimensions.</p>

  <p>Upon looking through the instrument, we find the fluid swarming
  with animals of various shapes and magnitudes. Some are darting
  through the water with great rapidity, while others are pursuing and
  devouring creatures more infinitesimal than themselves. Many are
  attached to the twig by long delicate threads, several have their
  bodies inclosed in a transparent tube, from one end of which the
  animal partly protrudes and then recedes, while others are covered by
  an elegant shell or case. The minutest kinds, many of which are so
  small that millions might be contained in a single drop of water,
  appear like mere animated globules, free, single, and of various
  colours, sporting about in every direction. Numerous species resemble
  pearly or opaline cups or vases, fringed round the margin with
  delicate fibres, that are in constant oscillation. Some of these are
  attached by spiral tendrils; others are united by a slender stem to
  one common trunk, appearing like a bunch of hare-bells; others are of
  a globular form, and grouped together in a definite pattern, on a
  tabular or spherical membranous case, for a certain period of their
  existence, and ultimately become detached and locomotive, while many
  are permanently clustered together, and die if separated from the
  parent mass. They have no organs of progressive motion, similar to
  those of beasts, birds, or fishes; and though many species are
  destitute of eyes, yet possess an accurate perception of the presence
  of other bodies, and pursue and capture their prey with unerring
  purpose.</p>

  <h2>THE CANARY.</h2>

  <p>This bird, which is now kept and reared throughout the whole of
  Europe, and even in Russia and Siberia, on account of its pretty
  form, docility, and sweet song, is a native of the Canary Isles. On
  the banks of small streams, in the pleasant valleys of those lovely
  islands, it builds its nest in the branches of the orange-trees, of
  which it is so fond, that even in this country the bird has been
  known to find its way into the greenhouse, and select the fork of one
  of the branches of an orange-tree on which to build its nest, seeming
  to be pleased with the sweet perfume of the blossoms.</p>
  <!-- [Illustration: CANARY.] -->

  <div class="illustration">
    <a name="image-0058"></a> <img src="img/0058.jpg" alt="Canary.">
  </div>

  <p>The bird has been known in Europe since the beginning of the
  sixteenth century, when a ship, having a large number of canaries on
  board destined for Leghorn, was wrecked on the coast of Italy. The
  birds having regained their liberty, flew to the nearest land, which
  happened to be the island of Elba, where they found so mild a climate
  that they built their nests there and became very numerous. But the
  desire to possess such beautiful songsters led to their being hunted
  after, until the whole wild race was quite destroyed. In Italy,
  therefore, we find the first tame canaries, and here they are still
  reared in great numbers. Their natural colour is grey, which merges
  into green beneath, almost resembling the colours of the linnet; but
  by means of domestication, climate, and being bred with other birds,
  canaries may now be met with of a great variety of colours. But
  perhaps there is none more beautiful than the golden-yellow, with
  blackish-grey head and tail. The hen canary lays her eggs four or
  five times a year, and thus a great number of young are produced.</p>

  <p>As they are naturally inhabitants of warm climates, and made still
  more delicate by constant residence in rooms, great care should be
  taken in winter that this favourite bird be not exposed to cold air,
  which, however refreshing to it in the heat of summer, is so
  injurious in this season that it causes sickness and even death. To
  keep canaries in a healthy and happy state, it is desirable that the
  cage should be frequently hung in brilliant daylight, and, if
  possible, placed in the warm sunshine, which, especially when
  bathing, is very agreeable to them. The more simple and true
  to-nature the food is, the better does it agree with them; and a
  little summer rapeseed mixed with their usual allowance of the seed
  to which they have given their name, will be found to be the best
  kind of diet. As a treat, a little crushed hempseed or summer
  cabbage-seed may be mixed with the canary-seed. The beautiful grass
  from which the latter is obtained is a pretty ornament for the
  garden; it now grows very abundantly in Kent.</p>

  <p>The song of the canary is not in this country at all like that of
  the bird in a state of nature, for it is a kind of compound of notes
  learned from other birds. It may be taught to imitate the notes of
  the nightingale, by being placed while young with that bird. Care
  must be taken that the male parent of the young canary be removed
  from the nest before the young ones are hatched, or it will be sure
  to acquire the note of its parent. The male birds of all the
  feathered creation are the only ones who sing; the females merely
  utter a sweet chirrup or chirp, so that from the hen canary the bird
  will run no risk of learning its natural note.</p>

  <h2>INDUSTRY AND APPLICATION.</h2>

  <p>Diligence, industry, and proper improvement of time are material
  duties of the young. To no purpose are they endowed with the best
  abilities, if they want activity for exerting them. Unavailing, in
  this case, will be every direction that can be given them, either for
  their temporal or spiritual welfare. In youth the habits of industry
  are most easily acquired; in youth the incentives to it are strong,
  from ambition and from duty, from emulation and hope, from all the
  prospects which the beginning of life affords. If, dead to these
  calls, you already languish in slothful inaction, what will be able
  to quicken the more sluggish current of advancing years? Industry is
  not only the instrument of improvement, but the foundation of
  pleasure. Nothing is so opposite to the true enjoyment of life as the
  relaxed and feeble state of an indolent mind. He who is a stranger to
  industry, may possess, but he cannot enjoy. For it is labour only
  which gives the relish to pleasure. It is the appointed vehicle of
  every good man. It is the indispensable condition of our possessing a
  sound mind in a sound body. Sloth is so inconsistent with both, that
  it is hard to determine whether it be a greater foe to virtue or to
  health and happiness. Inactive as it is in itself, its effects are
  fatally powerful. Though it appear a slowly-flowing stream, yet it
  undermines all that is stable and flourishing. It not only saps the
  foundation of every virtue, but pours upon you a deluge of crimes and
  evils.</p>

  <p>It is like water which first putrefies by stagnation, and then
  sends up noxious vapours and fills the atmosphere with death. Fly,
  therefore, from idleness, as the certain parent both of guilt and of
  ruin. And under idleness I include, not mere inaction only, but all
  that circle of trifling occupations in which too many saunter away
  their youth; perpetually engaged in frivolous society or public
  amusements, in the labours of dress or the ostentation of their
  persons. Is this the foundation which you lay for future usefulness
  and esteem? By such accomplishments do you hope to recommend
  yourselves to the thinking part of the world, and to answer the
  expectations of your friends and your country? Amusements youth
  requires: it were vain, it were cruel, to prohibit them. But, though
  allowable as the relaxation, they are most culpable as the business,
  of the young, for they then become the gulf of time and the poison of
  the mind; they weaken the manly powers; they sink the native vigour
  of youth into contemptible effeminacy.</p>

  <p>The river Jordan rises in the mountains of Lebanon, and falls into
  the little Lake Merom, on the banks of which Joshua describes the
  hostile Kings as pitching to fight against Israel. After passing
  through this lake, it runs down a rocky valley with great noise and
  rapidity to the Lake of Tiberias. In this part of its course the
  stream is almost hidden by shady trees, which grow on each side. As
  the river approaches the Lake of Tiberias it widens, and passes
  through it with a current that may be clearly seen during a great
  part of its course. It then reaches a valley, which is the lowest
  ground in the whole of Syria, many hundred feet below the level of
  the Mediterranean Sea. It is so well sheltered by the high land on
  both sides, that the heat thus produced and the moisture of the river
  make the spot very rich and fertile. This lovely plain is five or six
  miles across in parts, but widens as it nears the Dead Sea, whose
  waters cover the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, destroyed for the
  wickedness of their inhabitants.</p>

  <h2>FORTITUDE.</h2>

  <p>Without some degree of fortitude there can be no happiness,
  because, amidst the thousand uncertainties of life, there can be no
  enjoyment of tranquillity. The man of feeble and timorous spirit
  lives under perpetual alarms. He sees every distant danger and
  tremble; he explores the regions of possibility to discover the
  dangers that may arise: often he creates imaginary ones; always
  magnifies those that are real. Hence, like a person haunted by
  spectres, he loses the free enjoyment even of a safe and prosperous
  state, and on the first shock of adversity he desponds. Instead of
  exerting himself to lay hold on the resources that remain, he gives
  up all for lost, and resigns himself to abject and broken spirits. On
  the other hand, firmness of mind is the parent of tranquillity. It
  enables one to enjoy the present without disturbance, and to look
  calmly on dangers that approach or evils that threaten in future.
  Look into the heart of this man, and you will find composure,
  cheerfulness, and magnanimity; look into the heart of the other, and
  you will see nothing but confusion, anxiety, and trepidation. The one
  is a castle built on a rock, which defies the attacks of surrounding
  waters; the other is a hut placed on the shore, which every wind
  shakes and every wave overflows.</p>

  <p>How curious is the structure of the nest of the goldfinch or
  chaffinch! The inside of it is lined with cotton and fine silken
  threads; and the outside cannot be sufficiently admired, though it is
  composed only of various species of fine moss. The colour of these
  mosses, resembling that of the bark of the tree on which the nest is
  built, proves that the bird intended it should not be easily
  discovered. In some nests, hair, wool, and rushes are dexterously
  interwoven. In some, all the parts are firmly fastened by a thread,
  which the bird makes of hemp, wool, hair, or more commonly of
  spiders&#39; webs. Other birds, as for instance the blackbird and the
  lapwing, after they have constructed their nest, plaster the inside
  with mortar, which cements and binds the whole together; they then
  stick upon it, while quite wet, some wool or moss, to give it the
  necessary degree of warmth. The nests of swallows are of a very
  different construction from those of other birds. They require
  neither wood, nor hay, nor cords; they make a kind of mortar, with
  which they form a neat, secure, and comfortable habitation for
  themselves and their family. To moisten the dust, of which they build
  their nest, they dip their breasts in water and shake the drops from
  their wet feathers upon it. But the nests most worthy of admiration
  are those of certain Indian birds, which suspend them with great art
  from the branches of trees, to secure them from the depredations of
  various animals and insects. In general, every species of bird has a
  peculiar mode of building; but it may be remarked of all alike, that
  they always construct their nests in the way that is best adapted to
  their security, and to the preservation and welfare of their
  species.</p><!-- [Illustration: SWALLOW PREPARING A WALL FOR HER NEST.] -->

  <p>Such is the wonderful instinct of birds with respect to the
  structure of their nests. What skill and sagacity! what industry and
  patience do they display! And is it not apparent that all their
  labours tend towards certain ends? They construct their nests hollow
  and nearly round, that they may retain the heat so much the better.
  They line them with the most delicate substances, that the young may
  lie soft and warm. What is it that teaches the bird to place her nest
  in a situation sheltered from the rain, and secure against the
  attacks of other animals? How did she learn that she should lay
  eggs&mdash;that eggs would require a nest to prevent them from
  falling to the ground and to keep them warm? Whence does she know
  that the heat would not be maintained around the eggs if the nest
  were too large; and that, on the other hand, the young would not have
  sufficient room if it were smaller? By what rules does she determine
  the due proportions between the nest and the young which are not yet
  in existence? Who has taught her to calculate the time with such
  accuracy that she never commits a mistake, in producing her eggs
  before the nest is ready to receive them? Admire in all these things
  the power, the wisdom, and the goodness of the Creator!</p>

  <h2>THE BUSHMEN.</h2><!-- [Illustration: Letter T] -->

  <p>The Bosjesmans, or Bushmen, appear to be the remains of Hottentot
  hordes, who have been driven, by the gradual encroachments of the
  European colonists, to seek for refuge among the inaccessible rocks
  and sterile desert of the interior of Africa. Most of the hordes
  known in the colony by the name of Bushmen are now entirely destitute
  of flocks or herds, and subsist partly by the chase, partly on the
  wild roots of the wilderness, and in times of scarcity on reptiles,
  grasshoppers, and the larvae of ants, or by plundering their
  hereditary foes and oppressors, the frontier Boers. In seasons when
  every green herb is devoured by swarms of locusts, and when the wild
  game in consequence desert the pastures of the wilderness, the
  Bushman finds a resource in the very calamity which would overwhelm
  an agricultural or civilized community. He lives by devouring the
  devourers; he subsists for weeks and months on locusts alone, and
  also preserves a stock of this food dried, as we do herrings or
  pilchards, for future consumption.</p>

  <p>The Bushman retains the ancient arms of the Hottentot race,
  namely, a javelin or assagai, similar to that of the Caffres, and a
  bow and arrows. The latter, which are his principal weapons both for
  war and the chase, are small in size and formed of slight materials;
  but, owing to the deadly poison with which the arrows are imbued, and
  the dexterity with which they are launched, they are missiles truly
  formidable. One of these arrows, formed merely of a piece of slender
  reed tipped with bone or iron, is sufficient to destroy the most
  powerful animal. But, although the colonists very much dread the
  effects of the Bushman&#39;s arrow, they know how to elude its range;
  and it is after all but a very unequal match for the fire-lock, as
  the persecuted natives by sad experience have found. The arrows are
  usually kept in a quiver, formed of the hollow stalk of a species of
  aloe, and slung over the shoulder; but a few, for immediate use, are
  often stuck in a band round the head.</p>

  <p>A group of Bosjesmans, comprising two men, two women, and a child,
  were recently brought to this country and exhibited at the Egyptian
  Hall, in Piccadilly. The women wore mantles and conical caps of hide,
  and gold ornaments in their ears. The men also wore a sort of skin
  cloak, which hung down to their knees, over a close tunic: the legs
  and feet were bare in both. Their sheep-skin mantles, sewed together
  with threads of sinew, and rendered soft and pliable by friction,
  sufficed for a garment by day and a blanket by night. These
  Bosjesmans exhibited a variety of the customs of their native
  country. Their whoops were sometimes so loud as to be startling, and
  they occasionally seemed to consider the attention of the spectators
  as an affront.</p><!-- [Illustration: BUSHMEN.] -->

  <h2>CHARACTER OF ALFRED, KING OF ENGLAND.</h2>

  <p>The merit of this Prince, both in private and public life, may
  with advantage be set in opposition to that of any Monarch or citizen
  which the annals of any age or any nation can present to us. He
  seems, indeed, to be the realisation of that perfect character,
  which, under the denomination of a sage or wise man, the philosophers
  have been fond of delineating, rather as a fiction of their
  imagination than in hopes of ever seeing it reduced to practice; so
  happily were all his virtues tempered together, so justly were they
  blended, and so powerfully did each prevent the other from exceeding
  its proper bounds. He knew how to conciliate the most enterprising
  spirit with the coolest moderation; the most obstinate perseverance
  with the easiest flexibility; the most severe justice with the
  greatest lenity; the greatest rigour in command with the greatest
  affability of deportment; the highest capacity and inclination for
  science, with the most shining: talents for action. His civil and his
  military virtues are almost equally the objects of our admiration,
  excepting only, that the former, being more rare among princes, as
  well as more useful, seem chiefly to challenge our applause. Nature
  also, as if desirous that so bright a production of her skill should
  be set in the fairest light, had bestowed on him all bodily
  accomplishments, vigour of limbs, dignity of shape and air, and a
  pleasant, engaging, and open countenance. Fortune alone, by throwing
  him into that barbarous age, deprived him of historians worthy to
  transmit his fame to posterity; and we wish to see him delineated in
  more lively colours, and with more particular strokes, that we may at
  least perceive some of those small specks and blemishes, from which,
  as a man, it is impossible he could be entirely exempted.</p>

  <h2>ON CRUELTY TO INFERIOR ANIMALS</h2>
  <!-- [Illustration: Letter M] -->

  <div class="decoration">
    <a name="image-0069"></a> <img src="img/0069.jpg" alt="Letter M.">
  </div>

  <p>Man is that link of the chain of universal existence by which
  spiritual and corporeal beings are united: as the numbers and variety
  of the latter his inferiors are almost infinite, so probably are
  those of the former his superiors; and as we see that the lives and
  happiness of those below us are dependant on our wills, we may
  reasonably conclude that our lives and happiness are equally
  dependant on the wills of those above us; accountable, like
  ourselves, for the use of this power to the supreme Creator and
  governor of all things. Should this analogy be well founded, how
  criminal will our account appear when laid before that just and
  impartial judge! How will man, that sanguinary tyrant, be able to
  excuse himself from the charge of those innumerable cruelties
  inflicted on his unoffending subjects committed to his care, formed
  for his benefit, and placed under his authority by their common
  Father? whose mercy is over all his works, and who expects that his
  authority should be exercised, not only with tenderness and mercy,
  but in conformity to the laws of justice and gratitude.</p>

  <p>But to what horrid deviations from these benevolent intentions are
  we daily witnesses! no small part of mankind derive their chief
  amusements from the deaths and sufferings of inferior animals; a much
  greater, consider them only as engines of wood or iron, useful in
  their several occupations. The carman drives his horse, and the
  carpenter his nail, by repeated blows; and so long as these produce
  the desired effect, and they both go, they neither reflect or care
  whether either of them have any sense of feeling. The butcher knocks
  down the stately ox, with no more compassion than the blacksmith
  hammers a horseshoe; and plunges his knife into the throat of the
  innocent lamb, with as little reluctance as the tailor sticks his
  needle into the collar of a coat.</p>

  <p>If there are some few who, formed in a softer mould, view with
  pity the sufferings of these defenceless creatures, there is scarce
  one who entertains the least idea that justice or gratitude can be
  due to their merits or their services. The social and friendly dog is
  hanged without remorse, if, by barking in defence of his master&#39;s
  person and property, he happens unknowingly to disturb his rest; the
  generous horse, who has carried his ungrateful master for many years
  with ease and safety, worn out with age and infirmities, contracted
  in his service, is by him condemned to end his miserable days in a
  dust-cart, where the more he exerts his little remains of spirit, the
  more he is whipped to save his stupid driver the trouble of whipping
  some other less obedient to the lash. Sometimes, having been taught
  the practice of many unnatural and useless feats in a riding-house,
  he is at last turned out and consigned to the dominion of a
  hackney-coachman, by whom he is every day corrected for performing
  those tricks, which he has learned under so long and severe a
  discipline. The sluggish bear, in contradiction to his nature, is
  taught to dance for the diversion of a malignant mob, by placing
  red-hot irons under his feet; and the majestic bull is tortured by
  every mode which malice can invent, for no offence but that he is
  gentle and unwilling to assail his diabolical tormentors. These, with
  innumerable other acts of cruelty, injustice, and ingratitude, are
  every day committed, not only with impunity, but without censure and
  even without observation; but we may be assured that they cannot
  finally pass away unnoticed and unretaliated.</p>

  <p>The laws of self-defence undoubtedly justify us in destroying
  those animals who would destroy us, who injure our properties, or
  annoy our persons; but not even these, whenever their situation
  incapacitates them from hurting us. I know of no right which we have
  to shoot a bear on an inaccessible island of ice, or an eagle on the
  mountain&#39;s top; whose lives cannot injure us, nor deaths procure
  us any benefit. We are unable to give life, and therefore ought not
  wantonly to take it away from the meanest insect, without sufficient
  reason; they all receive it from the same benevolent hand as
  ourselves, and have therefore an equal right to enjoy it.</p>

  <p>God has been pleased to create numberless animals intended for our
  sustenance; and that they are so intended, the agreeable flavour of
  their flesh to our palates, and the wholesome nutriment which it
  administers to our stomachs, are sufficient proofs: these, as they
  are formed for our use, propagated by our culture, and fed by our
  care, we have certainly a right to deprive of life, because it is
  given and preserved to them on that condition; but this should always
  be performed with all the tenderness and compassion which so
  disagreeable an office will permit; and no circumstances ought to be
  omitted, which can render their executions as quick and easy as
  possible. For this Providence has wisely and benevolently provided,
  by forming them in such a manner that their flesh becomes rancid and
  unpalateable by a painful and lingering death; and has thus compelled
  us to be merciful without compassion, and cautious of their
  sufferings, for the sake of ourselves: but, if there are any whose
  tastes are so vitiated, and whose hearts are so hardened, as to
  delight in such inhuman sacrifices, and to partake of them without
  remorse, they should be looked upon as demons in human shape, and
  expect a retaliation of those tortures which they have inflicted on
  the innocent, for the gratification of their own depraved and
  unnatural appetites.</p>

  <p>So violent are the passions of anger and revenge in the human
  breast, that it is not wonderful that men should persecute their real
  or imaginary enemies with cruelty and malevolence; but that there
  should exist in nature a being who can receive pleasure from giving
  pain, would be totally incredible, if we were not convinced, by
  melancholy experience, that there are not only many, but that this
  unaccountable disposition is in some manner inherent in the nature of
  man; for, as he cannot be taught by example, nor led to it by
  temptation, or prompted to it by interest, it must be derived from
  his native constitution; and it is a remarkable confirmation of what
  revelation so frequently inculcates&mdash;that he brings into the
  world with him an original depravity, the effects of a fallen and
  degenerate state; in proof of which we need only to observe, that the
  nearer he approaches to a state of nature, the more predominant this
  disposition appears, and the more violently it operates. We see
  children laughing at the miseries which they inflict on every
  unfortunate animal which comes within their power; all savages are
  ingenious in contriving, and happy in executing, the most exquisite
  tortures; and the common people of all countries are delighted with
  nothing so much as bull-baitings, prize-fightings, executions, and
  all spectacles of cruelty and horror. Though civilization may in some
  degree abate this native ferocity, it can never quite extirpate it;
  the most polished are not ashamed to be pleased with scenes of little
  less barbarity, and, to the disgrace of human nature, to dignify them
  with the name of sports. They arm cocks with artificial weapons,
  which nature had kindly denied to their malevolence, and with shouts
  of applause and triumph see them plunge them into each other&#39;s
  hearts; they view with delight the trembling deer and defenceless
  hare, flying for hours in the utmost agonies of terror and despair,
  and, at last, sinking under fatigue, devoured by their merciless
  pursuers; they see with joy the beautiful pheasant and harmless
  partridge drop from their flight, weltering in their blood, or,
  perhaps, perishing with wounds and hunger, under the cover of some
  friendly thicket to which they have in vain retreated for safety;
  they triumph over the unsuspecting fish whom they have decoyed by an
  insidious pretence of feeding, and drag him from his native element
  by a hook fixed to and tearing out his entrails; and, to add to all
  this, they spare neither labour nor expense to preserve and propagate
  these innocent animals, for no other end but to multiply the objects
  of their persecution.</p>

  <p>What name would we bestow on a superior being, whose whole
  endeavours were employed, and whose whole pleasure consisted in
  terrifying, ensnaring, tormenting, and destroying mankind? whose
  superior faculties were exerted in fomenting animosities amongst
  them, in contriving engines of destruction, and inciting them to use
  them in maiming and murdering each other? whose power over them was
  employed in assisting the rapacious, deceiving the simple, and
  oppressing the innocent? who, without provocation or advantage,
  should continue from day to day, void of all pity and remorse, thus
  to torment mankind for diversion, and at the same time endeavour with
  his utmost care to preserve their lives and to propagate their
  species, in order to increase the number of victims devoted to his
  malevolence, and be delighted in proportion to the miseries he
  occasioned. I say, what name detestable enough could we find for such
  a being? yet, if we impartially consider the case, and our
  intermediate situation, we must acknowledge that, with regard to
  inferior animals, just such a being is a sportsman.</p>

  <h2>PETER THE HERMIT, AND THE FIRST CRUSADE.</h2>

  <p>It was in Palestine itself that Peter the Hermit first conceived
  the grand idea of rousing the powers of Christendom to rescue the
  Christians of the East from the thraldom of the Mussulman, and the
  Sepulchre of Jesus from the rude hands of the Infidel. The subject
  engrossed his whole mind. Even in the visions of the night he was
  full of it. One dream made such an impression upon him, that he
  devoutly believed the Saviour of the world Himself appeared before
  him, and promised him aid and protection in his holy undertaking. If
  his zeal had ever wavered before, this was sufficient to fix it for
  ever.</p>

  <p>Peter, after he had performed all the penances and duties of his
  pilgrimage, demanded an interview with Simeon, the Patriarch of the
  Greek Church at Jerusalem. Though the latter was a heretic in
  Peter&#39;s eyes, yet he was still a Christian, and felt as acutely
  as himself for the persecu tions heaped by the Turks upon the
  followers of Jesus. The good prelate entered fully into his views,
  and, at his suggestion, wrote letters to the Pope, and to the most
  influential Monarchs of Christendom, detailing the sorrows of the
  faithful, and urging them to take up arms in their defence. Peter was
  not a laggard in the work. Taking an affectionate farewell of the
  Patriarch, he returned in all haste to Italy. Pope Urban II. occupied
  the apostolic chair. It was at that time far from being an easy seat.
  His predecessor, Gregory, had bequeathed him a host of disputes with
  the Emperor Henry IV., of Germany; and he had made Philip I., of
  France, his enemy. So many dangers encompassed him about that the
  Vatican was no secure abode, and he had taken refuge in Apulia, under
  the protection of the renowned Robert Guiscard. Thither Peter appears
  to have followed him, though the spot in which their meeting took
  place is not stated with any precision by ancient chroniclers or
  modern historians. Urban received him most kindly, read with tears in
  his eyes the epistle from the Patriarch Simeon, and listened to the
  eloquent story of the Hermit with an attention which showed how
  deeply he sympathised with the woes of the Christian Church.</p>

    "Peter the Hermit Preaching the First Crusade.">
  </div>

  <p>Enthusiasm is contagious, and the Pope appears to have caught it
  instantly from one whose zeal was so unbounded. Giving the Hermit
  full powers, he sent him abroad to preach the Holy War to all the
  nations and potentates of Christendom. The Hermit preached, and
  countless thousands answered to his call. France, Germany, and Italy
  started at his voice, and prepared for the deliverance of Zion. One
  of the early historians of the Crusade, who was himself an
  eye-witness of the rapture of Europe, describes the personal
  appearance of the Hermit at this time. He says that there appeared to
  be something of divine in everything which he said or did. The people
  so highly reverenced him, that they plucked hairs from the mane of
  his mule, that they might keep them as relics. While preaching, he
  wore, in general, a woollen tunic, with a dark-coloured mantle which
  fell down to his heels. His arms and feet were bare, and he ate
  neither flesh nor bread, supporting himself chiefly upon fish and
  wine. &quot;He set out,&quot; said the chronicler, &quot;from whence
  I know not; but we saw him passing through towns and villages,
  preaching everywhere, and the people surrounding him in crowds,
  loading him with offerings, and celebrating his sanctity with such
  great praises, that I never remember to have seen such honours
  bestowed upon any one.&quot; Thus he went on, untired, inflexible,
  and full of devotion, communicating his own madness to his hearers,
  until Europe was stirred from its very depths.</p>

  <h2>QUEEN ELIZABETH&#39;S ADDRESS TO HER ARMY AT TILBURY FORT, IN
  1588.</h2>

  <p>My loving people! we have been persuaded by some that are careful
  of our safety, to take heed how we commit ourself to armed
  multitudes, for fear of treachery; but, I assure you, I do not desire
  to live to distrust my faithful and loving people. Let tyrants fear:
  I have always so behaved myself, that, under God, I have placed my
  chief strength and safeguard in the loyal hearts and good-will of my
  subjects. And, therefore, I am come among you at this time, not for
  my recreation or sport, but being resolved, in the midst and heat of
  the battle, to live or die among you all, and to lay down for my God,
  and for my kingdom, and for my people, my honour and my
  blood&mdash;even in the dust. I know I have the body of a weak and
  feeble woman; but I have the heart of a King, and the heart of a King
  of England, too! and think foul scorn, that Parma, or Spain, or any
  Prince of Europe, should dare to invade the borders of my realms; to
  which, rather than dishonour should grow by me, I myself will take up
  arms&mdash;I myself will be your general, your judge, and the
  rewarder of every one of your virtues in the field. I know already,
  by your forwardness, that you have deserved rewards and crowns; and
  we do assure you, on the word of a Prince, they shall be duly paid
  you. In the meantime, my Lieutenant-General shall be in my stead,
  than whom never Prince commanded more noble and worthy subject; nor
  do I doubt, by your obedience to my General, by your concord in the
  camp, and your valour in the field, we shall shortly have a famous
  victory over the enemies of my God, my kingdom, and my people.</p>

  <p>The city of Jalapa, in Mexico, is very beautifully situated at the
  foot of Macultepec, at an elevation of 4335 feet above the level of
  the sea; but as this is about the height which the strata of clouds
  reach, when suspended over the ocean, they come in contact with the
  ridge of the Cordillera Mountains; this renders the atmosphere
  exceedingly humid and disagreeable, particularly in north-easterly
  winds. In summer, however, the mists disappear; the climate is
  perfectly delightful, as the extremes of heat and cold are never
  experienced.</p>

  <p>On a bright sunny day, the scenery round Jalapa is not to be
  surpassed. Mountains bound the horizon, except on one side, where a
  distant view of the sea adds to the beauty of the scene. Orizaba,
  with its snow-capped peak, appears so close, that one imagines that
  it is within a few hours&#39; reach, and rich evergreen forests
  clothe the surrounding hills. In the foreground are beautiful
  gardens, with fruits of every clime&mdash;the banana and fig, the
  orange, cherry, and apple. The town is irregularly built, but very
  picturesque; the houses are in the style of the old houses of Spain,
  with windows down to the ground, and barred, in which sit the
  Jalapenas ladies, with their fair complexions and black eyes.</p>

  <p>Near Jalapa are two or three cotton factories, under the
  management of English and Americans: the girls employed are all
  Indians, healthy and good-looking; they are very apt in learning
  their work, and soon comprehend the various uses of the machinery. In
  the town there is but little to interest the stranger, but the church
  is said to have been founded by Cortez, and there is also a
  Franciscan convent. The vicinity of Jalapa, although poorly
  cultivated, produces maize, wheat, grapes, and jalap, from which
  plant the well-known medicine is prepared, and the town takes its
  name. A little lower down the Cordillera grows the vanilla, the bean
  of which is so highly esteemed for its aromatic flavour.</p>
  <!-- [Illustration: TOWN OF JALAPA, IN MEXICO] -->

    "Town of Jalapa, in Mexico.">
  </div>

  <p>The road from Jalapa to the city of Mexico constantly ascends, and
  the scenery is mountainous and grand; the villages are but few, and
  fifteen or twenty miles apart, with a very scanty population. No
  signs of cultivation are to be seen, except little patches of maize
  and chil&eacute;, in the midst of which is sometimes to be seen an
  Indian hut formed of reeds and flags. The mode of travelling in this
  country is by diligences, but these are continually attacked and
  robbed; and so much is this a matter of course, that the Mexicans
  invariably calculate a certain sum for the expenses of the road,
  including the usual fee for the banditti. Baggage is sent by the
  muleteers, by which means it is ensured from all danger, although a
  long time on the road. The Mexicans never think of resisting these
  robbers, and a coach-load of eight or nine is often stopped and
  plundered by one man. The foreigners do not take matters so quietly,
  and there is scarcely an English or American traveller in the country
  who has not come to blows in a personal encounter with the banditti
  at some period or other of his adventures.</p>

  <hr class="long">

  <h2>CONDORS.</h2><!-- [Illustration: Letter C] -->

  <div class="decoration">
    <a name="image-0077"></a> <img src="img/0077.jpg" alt="Letter C.">
  </div>

  <p>Condors are found throughout the whole range of the Cordilleras,
  along the south-west coast of South America, from the Straits of
  Magellan to the Rio Negro. Their habitations are almost invariably on
  overhanging ledges of high and perpendicular cliffs, where they both
  sleep and breed, sometimes in pairs, but frequently in colonies of
  twenty or thirty together. They make no nest, but lay two large white
  eggs on the bare rock. The young ones cannot use their wings for
  flight until many months after they are hatched, being covered,
  during that time, with only a blackish down, like that of a gosling.
  They remain on the cliff where they were hatched long after having
  acquired the full power of flight, roosting and hunting in company
  with the parent birds. Their food consists of the carcases of
  guanacoes, deer, cattle, and other animals.</p>

  <p>The condors may oftentimes be seen at a great height, soaring over
  a certain spot in the most graceful spires and circles. Besides
  feeding on carrion, the condors will frequently attack young goats
  and lambs. Hence, the shepherd dogs are trained, the moment the enemy
  passes over, to run out, and, looking upwards, to bark violently. The
  people of Chili destroy and catch great numbers. Two methods are
  used: one is to place a carcase within an inclosure of sticks on a
  level piece of ground; and when the condors are gorged, to gallop up
  on horseback to the entrance, and thus inclose them; for when this
  bird has not space to run, it cannot give its body sufficient
  momentum to rise from the ground. The second method is to mark the
  trees in which, frequently to the number of five or six together,
  they roost, and then at night to climb up and noose them. They are
  such heavy sleepers that this is by no means a difficult task.</p>

  <p>The condor, like all the vulture tribe, discovers his food from a
  great distance; the body of an animal is frequently surrounded by a
  dozen or more of them, almost as soon as it has dropped dead,
  although five minutes before there was not a single bird in view.
  Whether this power is to be attributed to the keenness of his
  olfactory or his visual organs, is a matter still in dispute;
  although it is believed, from a minute observation of its habits in
  confinement, to be rather owing to its quickness of sight.</p>

  <hr class="long">

  <h2>OMNISCIENCE AND OMNIPRESENCE OF THE DEITY.</h2>

  <p>I was yesterday, about sun-set, walking in the open fields, till
  the night insensibly fell upon me. I at first amused myself with all
  the richness and variety of colours which appeared in the western
  parts of heaven; in proportion as they faded away and went out,
  several stars and planets appeared one after another, till the whole
  firmament was in a glow. The blueness of the ether was exceedingly
  heightened and enlivened by the season of the year, and the rays of
  all those luminaries that passed through it. The Galaxy appeared in
  its most beautiful white. To complete the scene, the full moon rose
  at length in that clouded majesty which Milton takes notice of, and
  opened to the eye a new picture of nature, which was more finely
  shaded, and disposed among softer lights, than that which the sun had
  before discovered to us.</p>

  <p>As I was surveying the moon walking in her brightness, and taking
  her progress among the constellations, a thought arose in me, which I
  believe very often perplexes and disturbs men of serious and
  contemplative natures. David himself fell into it in that reflection,
  &quot;When I consider the heavens the work of thy fingers, the moon
  and the stars which thou hast ordained, what is man that though art
  mindful of him, and the son of man that thou regardest him!&quot; In
  the same manner, when I consider that infinite host of stars, or, to
  speak more philosophically, of suns, which were then shining upon me,
  with those innumerable sets of planets or worlds, which were moving
  round their respective suns; when I still enlarged the idea, and
  supposed another heaven of suns and worlds rising still above this
  which we discovered, and these still enlightened by a superior
  firmament of luminaries, which are planted at so great a distance,
  that they may appear to the inhabitants of the former as the stars do
  to us; in short, while I pursued this thought, I could not but
  reflect on that little insignificant figure which I myself bore
  amidst the immensity of God&#39;s works.</p>

  <p>Were the sun, which enlightens this part of the creation, with all
  the host of planetary worlds that move about him, utterly
  extinguished and annihilated, they would not be missed more than a
  grain of sand upon the sea-shore. The space they possess is so
  exceedingly little in comparison of the whole, it would scarce make a
  blank in creation. The chasm would be imperceptible to an eye that
  could take in the whole compass of nature, and pass from one end of
  creation to the other; as it is possible there may be such a sense in
  ourselves hereafter, or in creatures which are at present more
  exalted than ourselves. We see many stars by the help of glasses,
  which we do not discover with our naked eyes; and the finer our
  telescopes are, the more still are our discoveries. Huygenius carries
  this thought so far, that he does not think it impossible there may
  be stars whose light is not yet travelled down to us since their
  first creation. There is no question but the universe has certain
  bounds set to it; but when we consider that it is the work of
  infinite power, prompted by infinite goodness, with an infinite space
  to exert itself in, how can our imagination set any bounds to it?</p>

  <p>To return, therefore, to my first thought, I could not but look
  upon myself with secret horror, as a being that was not worth the
  smallest regard of one who had so great a work under his care and
  superintendency. I was afraid of being overlooked amidst the
  immensity of nature, and lost among that infinite variety of
  creatures, which in all probability swarm through all these
  immeasurable regions of matter.</p>

  <p>In order to recover myself from this mortifying thought, I
  considered that it took its rise from those narrow conceptions which
  we are apt to entertain of the Divine nature. We ourselves cannot
  attend to many different objects at the same time. If we are careful
  to inspect some things, we must of course neglect others. This
  imperfection which we observe in ourselves is an imperfection that
  cleaves in some degree to creatures of the highest capacities, as
  they are creatures, that is, beings of finite and limited natures.
  The presence of every created being is confined to a certain measure
  of space, and consequently his observation is stinted to a certain
  number of objects. The sphere in which we move, and act, and
  understand, is of a wider circumference to one creature than another,
  according as we rise one above another in the scale of existence. But
  the widest of these our spheres has its circumference. When therefore
  we reflect on the Divine nature, we are so used and accustomed to
  this imperfection in ourselves, that we cannot forbear in some
  measure ascribing it to Him in whom there is no shadow of
  imperfection. Our reason indeed assures us that his attributes are
  infinite; but the poorness of our conceptions is such, that it cannot
  forbear setting bounds to every thing it contemplates, till our
  reason comes again to our succour and throws down all those little
  prejudices which rise in us unawares, and are natural to the mind of
  man.</p>

  <p>We shall, therefore, utterly extinguish this melancholy thought of
  our being overlooked by our Maker in the multiplicity of his works,
  and the infinity of those objects among which He seems to be
  incessantly employed, if we consider, in the first place, that He is
  omnipresent; and in the second, that He is omniscient.</p>

  <p>If we consider Him in his omnipresence; his being passes through,
  actuates, and supports the whole frame of nature. His creation, and
  every part of it, is full of Him. There is nothing He has made that
  is either so distant, so little, or so inconsiderable, which He does
  not essentially inhabit. His substance is within the substance of
  every being, whether material or immaterial, and as intimately
  present to it as that being is to itself. It would be an imperfection
  in Him, were He able to move out of one place into another, or to
  draw himself from any thing He has created, or from any part of that
  space which He diffused and spread abroad to infinity. In short, to
  speak of Him in the language of the old philosophers, He is a being
  whose centre is everywhere and his circumference nowhere.</p>

  <p>In the second place, He is omniscient as well as omnipresent. His
  omniscience indeed necessarily and naturally flows from his
  omnipresence. He cannot but be conscious of every motion that arises
  in the whole material world which He thus essentially pervades; and
  of every thought that is stirring in the intellectual world, to every
  part of which He is thus intimately united. Several moralists have
  considered the creation as the temple of God, which He has built,
  with his own hands, and which is filled with his presence. Others
  have considered infinite space as the receptacle, or rather the
  habitation of the Almighty; but the noblest and most exalted way of
  considering this infinite space, is that of Sir Isaac Newton, who
  calls it the <i>se sorium</i> of the Godhead. Brutes and men have
  their <i>sensoriola</i>, or little <i>sensoriums</i>, by which they
  apprehend the presence and perceive the actions of a few objects that
  lie contiguous to them. Their knowledge and observation turn within a
  very narrow circle. But, as God Almighty cannot but perceive and know
  everything in which He resides, infinite space gives room to infinite
  knowledge, and is, as it were, an organ to omniscience.</p>

  <p>Were the soul separate from the body, and with one glance of
  thought should start beyond the bounds of the creation, should it
  millions of years continue its progress through infinite space with
  the same activity, it would still find itself within the embrace of
  its Creator, and encompassed round with the immensity of the Godhead.
  While we are in the body, He is not less present with us, because He
  is concealed from us. &quot;Oh, that I knew where I might find
  Him!&quot; says Job. &quot;Behold I go forward, but He is not there;
  and backward, but I cannot perceive Him; on the left hand, where He
  does work, but I cannot behold Him; He hideth himself on the right
  hand, that I cannot see Him.&quot; In short, reason as well as
  revelation assures us that He cannot be absent from us,
  notwithstanding He is undiscovered by us.</p>

  <p>In this consideration of God Almighty&#39;s omnipresence and
  omniscience, every uncomfortable thought vanishes. He cannot but
  regard everything that has being, especially such of his creatures
  who fear they are not regarded by Him. He is privy to all their
  thoughts, and to that anxiety of heart in particular, which is apt to
  trouble them on this occasion; for, as it is impossible He should
  overlook any of his creatures, so we may be confident that He
  regards, with an eye of mercy, those who endeavour to recommend
  themselves to his notice, and in unfeigned humility of heart think
  themselves unworthy that He should be mindful of them.</p>

  <h2>ENVY.</h2><!-- [Illustration: Letter E] -->

  <div class="decoration">
    <a name="image-0082"></a> <img src="img/0082.jpg" alt="Letter E.">
  </div>

  <p>Envy is almost the only vice which is practicable at all times,
  and in every place&mdash;the only passion which can never lie quiet
  for want of irritation; its effects, therefore, are everywhere
  discoverable, and its attempts always to be dreaded.</p>

  <p>It is impossible to mention a name, which any advantageous
  distinction has made eminent, but some latent animosity will burst
  out. The wealthy trader, however he may abstract himself from public
  affairs, will never want those who hint with Shylock, that ships are
  but boards, and that no man can properly be termed rich whose fortune
  is at the mercy of the winds. The beauty adorned only with the
  unambitious graces of innocence and modesty, provokes, whenever she
  appears, a thousand murmurs of detraction and whispers of suspicion.
  The genius, even when he endeavours only to entertain with pleasing;
  images of nature, or instruct by uncontested principles of science,
  yet suffers persecution from innumerable critics, whose acrimony is
  excited merely by the pain of seeing others pleased&mdash;of hearing
  applauses which another enjoys.</p>

  <p>The frequency of envy makes it so familiar that it escapes our
  notice; nor do we often reflect upon its turpitude or malignity, till
  we happen to feel its influence. When he that has given no
  provocation to malice, but by attempting to excel in some useful art,
  finds himself pursued by multitudes whom he never saw with
  implacability of personal resentment; when he perceives clamour and
  malice let loose upon him as a public enemy, and incited by every
  stratagem of defamation; when he hears the misfortunes of his family
  or the follies of his youth exposed to the world; and every failure
  of conduct, or defect of nature, aggravated and ridiculed; he then
  learns to abhor those artifices at which he only laughed before, and
  discovers how much the happiness of life would be advanced by the
  eradication of envy from the human heart.</p>

  <p>Envy is, indeed, a stubborn weed of the mind, and seldom yields to
  the culture of philosophy. There are, however, considerations which,
  if carefully implanted, and diligently propagated, might in time
  overpower and repress it, since no one can nurse it for the sake of
  pleasure, as its effects are only shame, anguish, and perturbation.
  It is, above all other vices, inconsistent with the character of a
  social being, because it sacrifices truth and kindness to very weak
  temptations. He that plunders a wealthy neighbour, gains as much as
  he takes away, and improves his own condition in the same proportion
  as he impairs another&#39;s; but he that blasts a flourishing
  reputation, must be content with a small dividend of additional fame,
  so small as can afford very little consolation to balance the guilt
  by which it is obtained.</p>

  <p>I have hitherto avoided mentioning that dangerous and empirical
  morality, which cures one vice by means of another. But envy is so
  base and detestable, so vile in its original, and so pernicious in
  its effects, that the predominance of almost any other quality is to
  be desired. It is one of those lawless enemies of society, against
  which poisoned arrows may honestly be used. Let it therefore be
  constantly remembered, that whoever envies another, confesses his
  superiority; and let those be reformed by their pride, who have lost
  their virtue.</p>

  <p>Almost every other crime is practised by the help of some quality
  which might have produced esteem or love, if it had been well
  employed; but envy is a more unmixed and genuine evil; it pursues a
  hateful end by despicable means, and desires not so much its own
  happiness as another&#39;s misery. To avoid depravity like this, it
  is not necessary that any one should aspire to heroism or sanctity;
  but only that he should resolve not to quit the rank which nature
  assigns, and wish to maintain the dignity of a human being.</p>

  <h2>THE OLIVE.</h2>

  <p>No tree is more frequently mentioned by ancient authors, nor was
  any more highly honoured by ancient nations, than the olive. By the
  Greeks it was dedicated to the goddess of wisdom, and formed the
  crown of honour given to their Emperors and great men, as with the
  Romans. It is a tree of slow growth, but remarkable for the great age
  it attains; never, however, becoming a very large tree, though
  sometimes two or three stems rise from the same root, and reach the
  height of from twenty to thirty feet. The leaves grow in pairs,
  lanceolate in shape, of a dull green on the upper, and hoary on the
  under side. Hence, in countries where the olive is extensively
  cultivated, the scenery is of a dull character, from this colour of
  the foliage. The fruit is oval in shape, with a hard strong kernel,
  and remarkable from the outer fleshy part being that in which much
  oil is lodged, and not, as is usual, in the seed. It ripens from
  August to September.</p>

  <p>Of the olive-tree two varieties are particularly distinguished:
  the long-leafed, which is cultivated in the south of France and in
  Italy; and the broad-leafed in Spain, which has its fruit much longer
  than that of the former kind.</p>
  <!-- [Illustration: OLIVE TREES, GETHSEMANE.] -->

  <div class="illustration">
    <a name="image-0084"></a> <img src="img/0084.jpg" alt=
    "Olive Trees, Gethsemane.">
  </div>

  <p>That the olive grows to a great age, has long been known. Pliny
  mentions one which the Athenians of his time considered to be
  co&euml;val with their city, and therefore 1600 years old; and near
  Terni, in the vale of the cascade of Marmora, there is a plantation
  of very old trees, supposed to consist of the same plants that were
  growing there in the time of Pliny. Lady Calcott states that on the
  mountain road between Tivoli and Palestrina, there is an ancient
  olive-tree of large dimensions, which, unless the documents are
  purposely falsified, stood as a boundary between two possessions even
  before the Christian era. Those in the garden of Olivet or Gethsemane
  are at least of the time of the Eastern Empire, as is proved by the
  following circumstance:&mdash;In Turkey every olive-tree found
  standing by the Mussulmans, when they conquered Asia, pays one medina
  to the treasury, while each of those planted since the conquest is
  taxed half its produce. The eight olives of which we are speaking are
  charged only eight medinas. By some it is supposed that these
  olive-trees may have been in existence even in the time of our
  Saviour; the largest is about thirty feet in girth above the roots,
  and twenty-seven feet high.</p>

  <h2>ACCORDANCE BETWEEN THE SONGS OF BIRDS AND THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS
  OF THE DAY.</h2><!-- [Illustration: Letter T] -->

  </div>

  <p>There is a beautiful propriety in the order in which Nature seems
  to have directed the singing-birds to fill up the day with their
  pleasing harmony. The accordance between their songs and the external
  aspect of nature, at the successive periods of the day at which they
  sing, is quite remarkable. And it is impossible to visit the forest
  or the sequestered dell, where the notes of the feathered tribes are
  heard to the greatest advantage, without being impressed with the
  conviction that there is design in the arrangement of this sylvan
  minstrelsy.&mdash;</p><!-- [Illustration: THE ROBIN.] -->

  <div class="illustration">
    <a name="image-0085b"></a> <img src="img/0085b.jpg" alt=
    "The Robin.">
  </div>

  <p>First the robin (and not the lark, as has been generally
  imagined), as soon as twilight has drawn its imperceptible line
  between night and day, begins his lovely song. How sweetly does this
  harmonise with the soft dawning of the day! He goes on till the
  twinkling sun-beams begin to tell him that his notes no longer accord
  with the rising scene. Up starts the lark, and with him a variety of
  sprightly songsters, whose lively notes are in perfect correspondence
  with the gaiety of the morning. The general warbling continues, with
  now and then an interruption by the transient croak of the raven, the
  scream of the jay, or the pert chattering of the daw. The
  nightingale, unwearied by the vocal exertions of the night, joins his
  inferiors in sound in the general harmony. The thrush is wisely
  placed on the summit of some lofty tree, that its loud and piercing
  notes may be softened by distance before they reach the ear; while
  the mellow blackbird seeks the inferior branches.</p>
  <!-- [Illustration: THE LARK.] -->

  <div class="illustration">
    <a name="image-0085c"></a> <img src="img/0085c.jpg" alt=
    "The Lark.">
  </div>

  <p>Should the sun, having been eclipsed by a cloud, shine forth with
  fresh effulgence, how frequently we see the goldfinch perch on some
  blossomed bough, and hear its song poured forth in a strain
  peculiarly energetic; while the sun, full shining on his beautiful
  plumes, displays his golden wings and crimson crest to charming
  advantage. The notes of the cuckoo blend with this cheering concert
  in a pleasing manner, and for a short time are highly grateful to the
  ear. But sweet as this singular song is, it would tire by its
  uniformity, were it not given in so transient a manner.</p>
  <!-- [Illustration: THE LINNET.] -->

  <div class="illustration">
    <a name="image-0085d"></a> <img src="img/0085d.jpg" alt=
    "The Linnet.">
  </div>

  <p>At length evening advances, the performers gradually retire, and
  the concert softly dies away. The sun is seen no more. The robin
  again sends up his twilight song, till the more serene hour of night
  sets him to the bower to rest. And now to close the scene in full and
  perfect harmony; no sooner is the voice of the robin hushed, and
  night again spreads in gloom over the horizon, than the owl sends
  forth his slow and solemn tones. They are more than plaintive and
  less than melancholy, and tend to inspire the imagination with a
  train of contemplations well adapted to the serious hour.</p>

  <p>Thus we see that birds bear no inconsiderable share in harmonizing
  some of the most beautiful and interesting scenes in nature.</p>

  <h2>CHARACTER OF EDWARD VI.</h2>

  <p>Thus died Edward VI., in the sixteenth year of his age. He was
  counted the wonder of his time; he was not only learned in the
  tongues and the liberal sciences, but he knew well the state of his
  kingdom. He kept a table-book, in which he had written the characters
  of all the eminent men of the nation: he studied fortification, and
  understood the mint well. He knew the harbours in all his dominions,
  with the depth of the water, and way of coming into them. He
  understood foreign affairs so well, that the ambassadors who were
  sent into England, published very extraordinary things of him in all
  the courts of Europe. He had great quickness of apprehension, but
  being distrustful of his memory, he took notes of everything he heard
  that was considerable, in Greek characters, that those about him
  might not understand what he writ, which he afterwards copied out
  fair in the journal that he kept. His virtues were wonderful; when he
  was made to believe that his uncle was guilty of conspiring the death
  of the other councillors, he upon that abandoned him.</p>

  <p>Barnaby Fitzpatrick was his favourite; and when he sent him to
  travel, he writ oft to him to keep good company, to avoid excess and
  luxury, and to improve himself in those things that might render him
  capable of employment at his return. He was afterwards made Lord of
  Upper Ossory, in Ireland, by Queen Elizabeth, and did answer the
  hopes this excellent King had of him. He was very merciful in his
  nature, which appeared in his unwillingness to sign the warrant for
  burning the Maid of Kent. He took great care to have his debts well
  paid, reckoning that a Prince who breaks his faith and loses his
  credit, has thrown up that which he can never recover, and made
  himself liable to perpetual distrust and extreme contempt. He took
  special care of the petitions that were given him by poor and opprest
  people. But his great zeal for religion crowned all the rest&mdash;it
  was a true tenderness of conscience, founded on the love of God and
  his neighbour. These extraordinary qualities, set off with great
  sweetness and affability, made him universally beloved by his
  people.</p>

  <p>Hunting has been a favourite sport in Britain for many centuries.
  Dyonisius (B.C. 50) tells us that the North Britons lived, in great
  part, upon the food they procured by hunting. Strabo states that the
  dogs bred in Britain were highly esteemed on the Continent, on
  account of their excellent qualities for hunting; and Caesar tells us
  that venison constituted a great portion of the food of the Britons,
  who did not eat hares. Hunting was also in ancient times a Royal and
  noble sport: Alfred the Great hunted at twelve years of age;
  Athelstan, Edward the Confessor, Harold, William the Conqueror,
  William Rufus, and John were all good huntsmen; Edward II. reduced
  hunting to a science, and established rules for its practice; Henry
  IV. appointed a master of the game; Edward III. hunted with sixty
  couples of stag-hounds; Elizabeth was a famous huntswoman; and James
  I. preferred hunting to hawking or shooting. The Bishops and Abbots
  of the middle ages hunted with great state. Ladies also joined in the
  chase from the earliest times; and a lady&#39;s hunting-dress in the
  fifteenth century scarcely differed from the riding-habit of the
  present day.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth his wife, actuated by his undaunted spirit, applied to
  the House of Lords for his release; and, according to her relation,
  she was told, &quot;they could do nothing; but that his releasement
  was committed to the Judges at the next assizes.&quot; The Judges
  were Sir Matthew Hale and Mr. Justice Twisden; and a remarkable
  contrast appeared between the well-known meekness of the one, and
  fury of the other. Elizabeth came before them, and, stating her
  husband&#39;s case, prayed for justice: &quot;Judge Twisden,&quot;
  says John Bunyan, &quot;snapt her up, and angrily told her that I was
  a convicted person, and could not be released unless I would promise
  to preach no more. <i>Elizabeth</i>: &#39;The Lords told me that
  releasement was committed to you, and you give me neither releasement
  nor relief. My husband is unlawfully in prison, and you are bound to
  discharge him.&#39; <i>Twisden</i>: &#39;He has been lawfully
  convicted.&#39; <i>Elizabeth</i>: &#39;It is false, for when they
  said &quot;Do you confess the indictment?&quot; he answered, &quot;At
  the meetings where he preached, they had God&#39;s presence among
  them.&quot;&#39; <i>Twisden</i>: &#39;Will your husband leave
  preaching? if he will do so, then send for him.&#39;
  <i>Elizabeth</i>: &#39;My Lord, he dares not leave off preaching as
  long as he can speak. But, good my Lords, consider that we have four
  small children, one of them blind, and that they have nothing to live
  upon while their father is in prison, but the charity of Christian
  people.&#39; <i>Sir Matthew Hale</i>: &#39;Alas! poor woman.&#39;
  <i>Twisden</i>: &#39;Poverty is your cloak, for I hear your husband
  is better maintained by running up and down a-preaching than by
  following his calling?&#39; <i>Sir Matthew Hale</i>: &#39;What is his
  calling?&#39; <i>Elizabeth</i>: &#39;A tinker, please you my Lord;
  and because he is a tinker, and a poor man, therefore he is despised
  and cannot have justice.&#39; <i>Sir Matthew Hale</i>: &#39;I am
  truly sorry we can do you no good. Sitting here we can only act as
  the law gives us warrant; and we have no power to reverse the
  sentence, although it may be erroneous. What your husband said was
  taken for a confession, and he stands convicted. There is, therefore,
  no course for you but to apply to the King for a pardon, or to sue
  out a writ of error; and, the indictment, or subsequent proceedings,
  being shown to be contrary to law, the sentence shall be reversed,
  and your husband shall be set at liberty. I am truly sorry for your
  pitiable case. I wish I could serve you, but I fear I can do you no
  good.&#39;&quot;</p>

  <p>Little do we know what is for our permanent good. Had Bunyan then
  been discharged and allowed to enjoy liberty, he no doubt would have
  returned to his trade, filling up his intervals of leisure with
  field-preaching; his name would not have survived his own generation,
  and he could have done little for the religious improvement of
  mankind. The prison doors were shut upon him for twelve years. Being
  cut off from the external world, he communed with his own soul; and,
  inspired by Him who touched Isaiah&#39;s hallowed lips with fire, he
  composed the noblest of allegories, the merit of which was first
  discovered by the lowly, but which is now lauded by the most refined
  critics, and which has done more to awaken piety, and to enforce the
  precepts of Christian morality, than all the sermons that have been
  published by all the prelates of the Anglican Church.</p>

  <h2>THE LONG-EARED AFRICAN FOX.</h2>

  <p>This singular variety of the Fox was first made known to
  naturalists in 1820, after the return of De Laland from South Africa.
  It is an inhabitant of the mountains in the neighbourhood of the Cape
  of Good Hope, but it is so rare that little is known of its habits in
  a state of nature. The Engraving was taken from a specimen which has
  been lately placed in the Zoological Society&#39;s gardens in the
  Regent&#39;s Park. It is extremely quick of hearing, and there is
  something in the general expression of the head which suggests a
  resemblance to the long-eared bat. Its fur is very thick, and the
  brush is larger than that of our common European fox. The skin of the
  fox is in many species very valuable; that of another kind of fox at
  the Cape of Good Hope is so much in request among the natives as a
  covering for the cold season, that many of the Bechuanas are solely
  employed in hunting the animal down with dogs, or laying snares in
  the places to which it is known to resort.</p><!-- [Illustration] -->

  <div class="illustration">
    <a name="image-0090"></a> <img src="img/0090.jpg" alt=
    "The Long-Eared African Fox.">
  </div>

  <p>In common with all other foxes, those of Africa are great enemies
  to birds which lay their eggs upon the ground; and their movements
  are, in particular, closely watched by the ostrich during the laying
  season. When the fox has surmounted all obstacles in procuring eggs,
  he has to encounter the difficulty of getting at their contents; but
  even for this task his cunning finds an expedient, and it is that of
  pushing them forcibly along the ground until they come in contact
  with some substance hard enough to break them, when the contents are
  speedily disposed of.</p>

  <p>The natives, from having observed the anxiety of the ostrich to
  keep this animal from robbing her nest, avail themselves of this
  solicitude to lure the bird to its destruction; for, seeing that it
  runs to the nest the instant a fox appears, they fasten a dog near
  it, and conceal themselves close by, and the ostrich, on approaching
  to drive away the supposed fox, is frequently shot by the real
  hunter.</p>

  <p>The fur of the red fox of America is much valued as an article of
  trade, and about 8000 are annually imported into England from the fur
  countries, where the animal is very abundant, especially in the
  wooded parts.</p>

  <p>Foxes of various colours are also common in the fur countries of
  North America, and a rare and valuable variety is the black or silver
  fox. Dr. Richardson states that seldom more than four or five of this
  variety are taken in a season at one post, though the hunters no
  sooner find out the haunts of one, than they use every art to catch
  it, because its fur fetches six times the price of any other fur
  produced in North America. This fox is sometimes found of a rich deep
  glossy black, the tip of the brush alone being white; in general,
  however, it is silvered over the end of each of the long hairs of the
  fur, producing a beautiful appearance.</p>

  <p>The Arctic fox resembles greatly the European species, but is
  considerably smaller; and, owing to the great quantity of white
  woolly fur with which it is covered, is somewhat like a little shock
  dog. The brush is very large and full, affording an admirable
  covering for the nose and feet, to which it acts as a muff when the
  animal sleeps. The fur is in the greatest perfection during the
  months of winter, when the colour gradually becomes from an ashy grey
  to a full and pure white, and is extremely thick, covering even the
  soles of the feet. Captain Lyon has given very interesting accounts
  of the habits of this animal, and describes it as being cleanly and
  free from any unpleasant smell: it inhabits the most northern lands
  hitherto discovered.</p><!-- [Illustration: Syrian Fox.] -->

  <h2>MOUNT TABOR.</h2>

  <p>The Plain of Esdraelon, in Palestine, is often mentioned in sacred
  history, as the great battle-field of the Jewish and other nations,
  under the names of the Valley of Mejiddo and the Valley of Jizreel,
  and by Josephus as the Great Plain. The convenience of its extent and
  situation for military action and display has, from the earliest
  periods of history down to our own day, caused its surface at certain
  intervals to be moistened with the blood, and covered with the bodies
  of conflicting warriors of almost every nation under heaven. This
  extensive plain, exclusive of three great arms which stretch eastward
  towards the Valley of the Jordan, may be said to be in the form of an
  acute triangle, having the measure of 13 or 14 miles on the north,
  about 18 on the east, and above 20 on the south-west. Before the
  verdure of spring and early summer has been parched up by the heat
  and drought of the late summer and autumn, the view of the Great
  Plain is, from its fertility and beauty, very delightful. In June,
  yellow fields of grain, with green patches of millet and cotton,
  chequer the landscape like a carpet. The plain itself is almost
  without villages, but there are several on the slopes of the
  inclosing hills, especially on the side of Mount Carmel. On the
  borders of this plain Mount Tabor stands out alone in magnificent
  grandeur. Seen from the south-west its fine proportions present a
  semi-globular appearance; but from the north-west it more resembles a
  truncated cone. By an ancient path, which winds considerably, one may
  ride to the summit, where is a small oblong plain with the
  foundations of ancient buildings. The view from the summit is
  declared by Lord Nugent to be the most splendid he could recollect
  having ever seen from any natural height. The sides of the mountain
  are mostly covered with bushes and woods of oak trees, with
  occasionally pistachio trees, presenting a beautiful appearance, and
  affording a welcome and agreeable shade. There are various tracks up
  its sides, often crossing each other, and the ascent generally
  occupies about an hour. The crest of the mountain is table-land, 600
  or 700 yards in height from north to south, and about half as much
  across, and a flat field of about an acre occurs at a level of some
  20 or 25 feet lower than the eastern brow. There are remains of
  several small ruined tanks on the crest, which still catch the rain
  water dripping through the crevices of the rock, and preserve it cool
  and clear, it is said, throughout the year.</p>

  <p>The tops of this range of mountains are barren, but the slopes and
  valleys afford pasturage, and are capable of cultivation, from the
  numerous springs which are met with in all directions. Cultivation
  is, however, chiefly found on the seaward slopes; there many
  flourishing villages exist, and every inch of ground is turned to
  account by the industrious natives.</p>

  <p>Seven miles from the sea-port of Boston, in Lincolnshire, lies the
  rural town of Swineshead, once itself a port, the sea having flowed
  up to the market-place, where there was a harbour. The name of
  Swineshead is familiar to every reader of English history, from its
  having been the resting-place of King John, after he lost the whole
  of his baggage, and narrowly escaped with his life, when crossing the
  marshes from Lynn to Sleaford, the castle of which latter place was
  then in his possession. The King halted at the Abbey, close to the
  town of Swineshead, which place he left on horseback; but being taken
  ill, was moved in a litter to Sleaford, and thence to his castle at
  Newark, where he died on the following day, in the year 1216.</p>

  <p>Apart from this traditional interest, Swineshead has other
  antiquarian and historical associations. The circular Danish
  encampment, sixty yards in diameter, surrounded by a double fosse,
  was, doubtless, a post of importance, when the Danes, or Northmen,
  carried their ravages through England in the time of Ethelred I., and
  the whole country passed permanently into the Danish hands about A.D.
  877. The incessant inroads of the Danes, who made constant descents
  on various parts of the coast, burning the towns and villages, and
  laying waste the country in all directions, led to that stain upon
  the English character, the Danish massacre. The troops collected to
  oppose these marauders always lost courage and fled, and their
  leaders, not seldom, set them the example. In 1002, peace was
  purchased for a sum of &pound;24,000 and a large supply of
  provisions. Meantime, the King and his councillors resolved to have
  recourse to a most atrocious expedient for their future security. It
  had been the practice of the English Kings, from the time of
  Athelstane, to have great numbers of Danes in their pay, as guards,
  or household troops; and these, it is said, they quartered on their
  subjects, one on each house. The household troops, like soldiers in
  general, paid great attention to their dress and appearance, and thus
  became very popular with the generality of people; but they also
  occasionally behaved with great insolence, and were also strongly
  suspected of holding secret intelligence with their piratical
  countrymen. It was therefore resolved to massacre the Hus-carles, as
  they were called, and their families, throughout England. Secret
  orders to this effect were sent to all parts, and on St. Brice&#39;s
  day, November 13th, 1002, the Danes were everywhere fallen on and
  slain. The ties of affinity (for many of them had married and settled
  in the country) were disregarded; even Gunhilda, sister to Sweyn,
  King of Denmark, though a Christian, was not spared, and with her
  last breath she declared that her death would bring the greatest
  evils upon England. The words of Gunhilda proved prophetic. Sweyn,
  burning for revenge and glad of a pretext for war, soon made his
  appearance on the south coast, and during four years he spread
  devastation through all parts of the country, until the King Ethelred
  agreed to give him &pound;30,000 and provisions as before for peace,
  and the realm thus had rest for two years. But this short peace was
  but a prelude to further disturbances; and indeed for two centuries,
  dating from the reign of Egbert, England was destined to become a
  prey to these fierce and fearless invaders.</p>

  <p>Having surveyed the various objects in Iona, we sailed for a spot
  no less interesting. Thousands have described it. Few, however, have
  seen it by torch or candle light, and in this respect we differ from
  most tourists. All description, however, of this far-famed wonder
  must be vain and fruitless. The shades of night were fast descending,
  and had settled on the still waves and the little group of islets,
  called the Treshnish Isles, when our vessel approached the celebrated
  Temple of the Sea. We had light enough to discern its symmetry and
  proportions; but the colour of the rock&mdash;a dark grey&mdash;and
  the minuter graces of the columns, were undistinguishable in the
  evening gloom. The great face of the rock is the most wonderful
  production of nature we ever beheld. It reminded us of the west front
  of York or Lincoln cathedral&mdash;a resemblance, perhaps, fanciful
  in all but the feelings they both excite&mdash;especially when the
  English minster is seen by moonlight. The highest point of Staffa at
  this view is about one hundred feet; in its centre is the great cave,
  called Fingal&#39;s Cave, stretching up into the interior of the rock
  a distance of more than 200 feet. After admiring in mute astonishment
  the columnar proportions of the rock, regular as if chiselled by the
  hand of art, the passengers entered a small boat, and sailed under
  the arch. The boatmen had been brought from Iona, and they instantly
  set themselves to light some lanterns, and form torches of old ropes
  and tar, with which they completely illuminated the ocean hall, into
  which we were ushered.</p>

  <p>The complete stillness of the scene, except the low plashing of
  the waves; the fitful gleams of light thrown first on the walls and
  ceiling, as the men moved to and fro along the side of the stupendous
  cave; the appearance of the varied roof, where different stalactites
  or petrifactions are visible; the vastness and perfect art or
  semblance of art of the whole, altogether formed a scene the most
  sublime, grand, and impressive ever witnessed.</p>

  <p>The Cathedral of Iona sank into insignificance before this great
  temple of nature, reared, as if in mockery of the temples of man, by
  the Almighty Power who laid the beams of his chambers on the waters,
  and who walketh upon the wings of the wind. Macculloch says that it
  is with the morning sun only that the great face of Staffa can be
  seen in perfection; as the general surface is undulating and uneven,
  large masses of light or shadow are thus produced. We can believe,
  also, that the interior of the cave, with its broken pillars and
  variety of tints, and with the green sea rolling over a dark red or
  violet-coloured rock, must be seen to more advantage in the full
  light of day. Yet we question whether we could have been more deeply
  sensible of the beauty and grandeur of the scene than we were under
  the unusual circumstances we have described. The boatmen sang a
  Gaelic <i>joram</i> or boat-song in the cave, striking their oars
  very violently in time with the music, which resounded finely through
  the vault, and was echoed back by roof and pillar. One of them, also,
  fired a gun, with the view of producing a still stronger effect of
  the same kind. When we had fairly satisfied ourselves with
  contemplating the cave, we all entered the boat and sailed round by
  the Clamshell Cave (where the basaltic columns are bent like the ribs
  of a ship), and the Rock of the Bouchaille, or the herdsman, formed
  of small columns, as regular and as interesting as the larger
  productions. We all clambered to the top of the rock, which affords
  grazing for sheep and cattle, and is said to yield a rent of
  &pound;20 per annum to the proprietor. Nothing but the wide surface
  of the ocean was visible from our mountain eminence, and after a few
  minutes&#39; survey we descended, returned to the boat, and after
  regaining the steam-vessel, took our farewell look of Staffa, and
  steered on for Tobermory.</p>

  <h2>ON CHEERFULNESS.</h2><!-- [Illustration: Letter I] -->

  <p>I have always preferred cheerfulness to mirth. The latter I
  consider as an act, the former as a habit of the mind. Mirth is short
  and transient, cheerfulness fixed and permanent. Those are often
  raised into the greatest transports of mirth, who are subject to the
  greatest depressions of melancholy: on the contrary, cheerfulness,
  though it does not give the mind such an exquisite gladness, prevents
  us from falling into any depths of sorrow. Mirth is like a flash of
  lightning, that breaks through a gloom of clouds, and glitters for a
  moment; cheerfulness keeps up a kind of daylight in the mind, and
  fills it with a steady and perpetual serenity.</p>

  <p>Men of austere principles look upon mirth as too wanton and
  dissolute for a state of probation, and as filled with a certain
  triumph and insolence of heart that is inconsistent with a life which
  is every moment obnoxious to the greatest dangers. Writers of this
  complexion have observed, that the sacred Person who was the great
  pattern of perfection, was never seen to laugh.</p>

  <p>Cheerfulness of mind is not liable to any of these exceptions; it
  is of a serious and composed nature; it does not throw the mind into
  a condition improper for the present state of humanity, and is very
  conspicuous in the characters of those who are looked upon as the
  greatest philosophers among the heathen, as well as among those who
  have been deservedly esteemed as saints and holy men among
  Christians.</p>

  <p>If we consider cheerfulness in three lights, with regard to
  ourselves, to those we converse with, and the great Author of our
  being, it will not a little recommend itself on each of these
  accounts. The man who is possessed of this excellent frame of mind,
  is not only easy in his thoughts, but a perfect master of all the
  powers and faculties of the soul; his imagination is always clear,
  and his judgment undisturbed; his temper is even and unruffled,
  whether in action or solitude. He comes with a relish to all those
  goods which nature has provided for him, tastes all the pleasures of
  the creation which are poured about him, and does not feel the full
  weight of those accidental evils which may befall him.</p>

  <p>If we consider him in relation to the persons whom he converses
  with, it naturally produces love and good-will towards him. A
  cheerful mind is not only disposed to be affable and obliging, but
  raises the same good-humour in those who come within its influence. A
  man finds himself pleased, he does not know why, with the
  cheerfulness of his companion: it is like a sudden sunshine, that
  awakens a secret delight in the mind, without her attending to it.
  The heart rejoices of its own accord, and naturally flows out into
  friendship and benevolence towards the person who has so kindly an
  effect upon it.</p>

  <p>When I consider this cheerful state of mind in its third relation,
  I cannot but look upon it as a constant, habitual gratitude to the
  great Author of nature.</p>

  <p>There are but two things which, in my opinion, can reasonably
  deprive us of this cheerfulness of heart. The first of these is the
  sense of guilt. A man who lives in a state of vice and impenitence,
  can have no title to that evenness and tranquillity of mind which is
  the health of the soul, and the natural effect of virtue and
  innocence. Cheerfulness in an ill man deserves a harder name than
  language can furnish us with, and is many degrees beyond what we
  commonly call folly or madness.</p>

  <p>Atheism, by which I mean a disbelief of a Supreme Being, and
  consequently of a future state, under whatsoever title it shelters
  itself, may likewise very reasonably deprive a man of this
  cheerfulness of temper. There is something so particularly gloomy and
  offensive to human nature in the prospect of non-existence, that I
  cannot but wonder, with many excellent writers, how it is possible
  for a man to outlive the expectation of it. For my own part, I think
  the being of a God is so little to be doubted, that it is almost the
  only truth we are sure of, and such a truth as we meet with in every
  object, in every occurrence, and in every thought. If we look into
  the characters of this tribe of infidels, we generally find they are
  made up of pride, spleen, and cavil: it is indeed no wonder that men
  who are uneasy to themselves, should be so to the rest of the world;
  and how is it possible for a man to be otherwise than uneasy in
  himself, who is in danger every moment of losing his entire existence
  and dropping into nothing?</p>

  <p>The vicious man and Atheist have therefore no pretence to
  cheerfulness, and would act very unreasonably should they endeavour
  after it. It is impossible for any one to live in good-humour and
  enjoy his present existence, who is apprehensive either of torment or
  of annihilation&mdash;of being miserable or of not being at all.</p>

  <p>After having mentioned these two great principles, which are
  destructive of cheerfulness in their own nature, as well as in right
  reason, I cannot think of any other that ought to banish this happy
  temper from a virtuous mind. Pain and sickness, shame and reproach,
  poverty and old age; nay, death itself, considering the shortness of
  their duration and the advantage we may reap from them, do not
  deserve the name of evils. A good mind may bear up under them with
  fortitude, with indolence, and with cheerfulness of heart. The
  tossing of a tempest does not discompose him, which he is sure will
  bring him to a joyful harbour.</p>

  <p>A man who uses his best endeavours to live according to the
  dictates of virtue and right reason, has two perpetual sources of
  cheerfulness, in the consideration of his own nature and of that
  Being on whom he has a dependence. If he looks into himself, he
  cannot but rejoice in that existence which is so lately bestowed upon
  him, and which, after millions of ages, will be still new and still
  in its beginning. How many self-congratulations naturally arise in
  the mind when it reflects on this its entrance into eternity, when it
  takes a view of those improvable faculties which in a few years, and
  even at its first setting out, have made so considerable a progress,
  and which will be still receiving an increase of perfection, and
  consequently an increase of happiness! The consciousness of such a
  being spreads a perpetual diffusion of joy through the soul of a
  virtuous man, and makes him look upon himself every moment as more
  happy than he knows how to conceive.</p>

  <p>The second source of cheerfulness to a good mind is its
  consideration of that Being on whom we have our dependence, and in
  whom, though we behold Him as yet but in the first faint discoveries
  of his perfections, we see every thing that we can imagine as great,
  glorious, and amiable. We find ourselves every where upheld by his
  goodness and surrounded with an immensity of love and mercy. In
  short, we depend upon a Being whose power qualifies Him to make us
  happy by an infinity of means, whose goodness and truth engage Him to
  make those happy who desire it of Him, and whose unchangeableness
  will secure us in this happiness to all eternity.</p>

  <p>Such considerations, which every one should perpetually cherish in
  his thoughts, will banish from us all that secret heaviness of heart
  which unthinking men are subject to when they lie under no real
  affliction, all that anguish which we may feel from any evil that
  actually oppresses us, to which I may likewise add those little
  cracklings of mirth and folly, that are apter to betray virtue than
  support it; and establish in us such an even and cheerful temper, as
  makes us pleasing to ourselves, to those with whom we converse, and
  to Him whom we are made to please.</p>

  <p>This is the place where King William Rufus was accidentally shot
  by Sir Walter Tyrrel. There has been much controversy on the details
  of this catastrophe; but the following conclusions, given in the
  &quot;Pictorial History of England,&quot; appear to be
  just:&mdash;&quot;That the King was shot by an arrow in the New
  Forest; that his body was abandoned and then hastily interred, are
  facts perfectly well authenticated; but some doubts may be
  entertained as to the precise circumstances attending his death,
  notwithstanding their being minutely related by writers who were
  living at the time, or who flourished in the course of the following
  century. Sir Walter Tyrrel afterwards swore, in France, that he did
  not shoot the arrow; but he was, probably, anxious to relieve himself
  from the odium of killing a King, even by accident. It is quite
  possible, indeed, that the event did not arise from chance, and that
  Tyrrel had no part in it. The remorseless ambition of Henry might
  have had recourse to murder, or the avenging shaft might have been
  sped by the desperate hand of some Englishman, tempted by a
  favourable opportunity and the traditions of the place. But the most
  charitable construction is, that the party were intoxicated with the
  wine they had drunk at Malwood-Keep, and that, in the confusion
  consequent on drunkenness, the King was hit by a random
  arrow.&quot;</p>

  <p>In that part of the Forest near Stony Cross, at a short distance
  from Castle Malwood, formerly stood an oak, which tradition affirmed
  was the tree against which the arrow glanced that caused the death of
  Rufus. Charles II. directed the tree to be encircled by a paling: it
  has disappeared; but the spot whereon the tree grew is marked by a
  triangular stone, about five feet high, erected by Lord Delaware,
  upwards of a century ago. The stone has since been faced with an iron
  casting of the following inscription upon the three sides:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&quot;Here stood the oak-tree on which an arrow, shot by Sir
  Walter Tyrrel at a stag, glanced and struck King William II.,
  surnamed Rufus, on the breast; of which stroke he instantly died, on
  the 2nd of August, 1100.</p>

  <p>&quot;King William II., surnamed Rufus, being slain, as before
  related, was laid in a cart belonging to one Purkess, and drawn from
  hence to Winchester, and buried in the cathedral church of that
  city.</p>

  <p>&quot; That where an event so memorable had happened might not
  hereafter be unknown, this stone was set up by John Lord Delaware,
  who had seen the tree growing in this place, anno 1745.&quot;</p>

  <p>Stony Cross is a favourite spot for pic-nic parties in the summer.
  It lies seven miles from Ringwood, on a wide slope among the woods.
  From the road above, splendid views over the country present
  themselves.</p><!-- [Illustration: STONY CROSS, NEW FOREST.] -->

  <p>The important feature which the Great Wall makes in the map of
  China, entitles this vast barrier to be considered in a geographical
  point of view, as it bounds the whole north of China along the
  frontiers of three provinces. It was built by the first universal
  Monarch of China, and finished about 205 years before Christ: the
  period of its completion is an historical fact, as authentic as any
  of those which the annals of ancient kingdoms have transmitted to
  posterity. It was built to defend the Chinese Empire from the
  incursions of the Tartars, and is calculated to be 1500 miles in
  length. The rapidity with which this work was completed is as
  astonishing as the wall itself, for it is said to have been done in
  five years, by many millions of labourers, the Emperor pressing three
  men out of every ten, in his dominions, for its execution. For about
  the distance of 200 leagues, it is generally built of stone and
  brick, with strong square towers, sufficiently near for mutual
  defence, and having besides, at every important pass, a formidable
  and well-built fortress. In many places, in this line and extent, the
  wall is double, and even triple; but from the province of Can-sih to
  its eastern extremity, it is nothing but a terrace of earth, of which
  the towers on it are also constructed. The Great Wall, which has now,
  even in its best parts, numerous breaches, is made of two walls of
  brick and masonry, not above a foot and a half in thickness, and
  generally many feet apart; the interval between them is filled up
  with earth, making the whole appear like solid masonry and brickwork.
  For six or seven feet from the earth, these are built of large square
  stones; the rest is of blue brick, the mortar used in which is of
  excellent quality. The wall itself averages about 20 feet in height,
  25 feet in thickness at the base, which diminishes to 15 feet at the
  platform, where there is a parapet wall; the top is gained by stairs
  and inclined planes. The towers are generally about 40 feet square at
  the base, diminishing to 30 feet a the top, and are, including
  battlements, 37 feet in height. At some spots the towers consist of
  two stories, and are thus much higher. The wall is in many places
  carried over the tops of the highest and most rugged rocks; and one
  of these elevated regions is 5000 feet above the level of the
  sea.</p><!-- [Illustration: MILITARY MANDARIN.] -->

  <p>Near each of the gates is a village or town; and at one of the
  principal gates, which opens on the road towards India, is situated
  Sinning-fu, a city of large extent and population. Here the wall is
  said to be sufficiently broad at the top to admit six horsemen
  abreast, who might without inconvenience ride a race. The esplanade
  on its top is much frequented by the inhabitants, and the stairs
  which give ascent are very broad and convenient.</p>

  <p>This delicious retreat in the island of Mauritius has no claims to
  the celebrity it has attained. It is not the burial-place of Paul and
  Virginia; and the author of &quot;Recollections of the
  Mauritius&quot; thus endeavours to dispel the illusion connected with
  the spot:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&quot;After having allowed his imagination to depict the shades of
  Paul and Virginia hovering about the spot where their remains
  repose&mdash;after having pleased himself with the idea that he had
  seen those celebrated tombs, and given a sigh to the memory of those
  faithful lovers, separated in life, but in death united&mdash;after
  all this waste of sympathy, he learns at last that he has been under
  a delusion the whole time&mdash;that no Virginia was there
  interred&mdash;and that it is a matter of doubt whether there ever
  existed such a person as Paul! What a pleasing illusion is then
  dispelled! How many romantic dreams, inspired by the perusal of St.
  Pierre&#39;s tale, are doomed to vanish when the truth is
  ascertained! The fact is, that these tombs have been built to gratify
  the eager desire which the English have always evinced to behold such
  interesting mementoes. Formerly only one was erected; but the
  proprietor of the place, finding that all the English visitors, on
  being conducted to this, as the tomb of Virginia, always asked to see
  that of Paul also, determined on building a similar one, to which he
  gave that appellation. Many have been the visitors who have been
  gratified, consequently, by the conviction that they had looked on
  the actual burial-place of that unfortunate pair. These
  &#39;tombs&#39; are scribbled over with the names of the various
  persons who have visited them, together with verses and pathetic
  ejaculations and sentimental remarks. St. Pierre&#39;s story of the
  lovers is very prettily written, and his description of the scenic
  beauties of the island are correct, although not even his pen can do
  full justice to them; but there is little truth in the tale. It is
  said that there was indeed a young lady sent from the Mauritius to
  France for education, during the time that Monsieur de la Bourdonnais
  was governor of the colony&mdash;that her name was Virginia, and that
  she was shipwrecked in the <i>St. Geran</i>. I heard something of a
  young man being attached to her, and dying of grief for her loss; but
  that part of the story is very doubtful. The &#39;Bay of the
  Tomb,&#39; the &#39;Point of Endeavour,&#39; the &#39;Isle of
  Amber,&#39; and the &#39;Cape of Misfortune,&#39; still bear the same
  names, and are pointed out as the memorable spots mentioned by St.
  Pierre.&quot;</p><!-- [Illustration: TOMBS OF PAUL AND VIRGINIA.] -->

  <h2>THE MANGOUSTE.</h2>

  <p>The Mangoustes, or Ichneumons, are natives of the hotter parts of
  the Old World, the species being respectively African and Indian. In
  their general form and habits they bear a great resemblance to the
  ferrets, being bold, active, and sanguinary, and unrelenting
  destroyers of birds, reptiles, and small animals, which they take by
  surprise, darting rapidly upon them. Beautiful, cleanly, and easily
  domesticated, they are often kept tame in the countries they
  naturally inhabit, for the purpose of clearing the houses of vermin,
  though the poultry-yard is not safe from their incursions.</p>

  <p>The Egyptian mangouste is a native of North Africa, and was
  deified for its services by the ancient Egyptians. Snakes, lizards,
  birds, crocodiles newly hatched, and especially the eggs of
  crocodiles, constitute its food. It is a fierce and daring animal,
  and glides with sparkling eyes towards its prey, which it follows
  with snake-like progression; often it watches patiently for hours
  together, in one spot, waiting the appearance of a mouse, rat, or
  snake, from its lurking-place. In a state of domestication it is
  gentle and affectionate, and never wanders from the house or returns
  to an independent existence; but it makes itself familiar with every
  part of the premises, exploring every hole and corner, inquisitively
  peeping into boxes and vessels of all kinds, and watching every
  movement or operation.</p><!-- [Illustration: THE MANGOUSTE] -->

  <div class="illustration">
    <a name="image-0111"></a> <img src="img/0111.jpg" alt=
    "The Mangouste.">
  </div>

  <p>The Indian mangouste is much less than the Egyptian, and of a
  beautiful freckled gray. It is not more remarkable for its graceful
  form and action, than for the display of its singular instinct for
  hunting for and stealing eggs, from which it takes the name of
  egg-breaker. Mr. Bennett, in his account of one of the mangoustes
  kept in the Tower, says, that on one occasion it killed no fewer than
  a dozen full-grown rats, which were loosened to it in a room sixteen
  feet square, in less than a minute and a half.</p>

  <p>Another species of the mangouste, found in the island of Java,
  inhabiting the large teak forests, is greatly admired by the natives
  for its agility. It attacks and kills serpents with excessive
  boldness. It is very expert in burrowing in the ground, which process
  it employs ingeniously in the pursuit of rats. It possesses great
  natural sagacity, and, from the peculiarities of its character, it
  willingly seeks the protection of man. It is easily tamed, and in its
  domestic state is very docile and attached to its master, whom it
  follows like a dog; it is fond of caresses, and frequently places
  itself erect on its hind legs, regarding every thing that passes with
  great attention. It is of a very restless disposition, and always
  carries its food to the most retired place to consume it, and is very
  cleanly in its habits; but it is exclusively carnivorous and
  destructive to poultry, employing great artifice in surprising
  chickens.</p>

  <p>Culloden Moor&mdash;the battle-field&mdash;lies eastward about a
  mile from Culloden House. After an hour&#39;s climbing up the heathy
  brae, through a scattered plantation of young trees, clambering over
  stone dykes, and jumping over moorland rills and springs, oozing from
  the black turf and streaking its sombre surface with stripes of
  green, we found ourselves on the table-land of the moor&mdash;a
  broad, bare level, garnished with a few black huts, and patches of
  scanty oats, won by patient industry from the waste. We should
  premise, however, that there are some fine glimpses of rude mountain
  scenery in the course of the ascent. The immediate vicinage of
  Culloden House is well wooded; the Frith spreads finely in front; the
  Ross-shire hills assume a more varied and commanding aspect; and Ben
  Wyvis towers proudly over his compeers, with a bold pronounced
  character. Ships were passing and re-passing before us in the Frith,
  the birds were singing blithely overhead, and the sky was without a
  cloud. Under the cheering influence of the sun, stretched on the
  warm, blooming, and fragrant heather, we gazed with no common
  interest and pleasure on this scene.</p>

  <p>On the moor all is bleak and dreary&mdash;long, flat, wide,
  unvarying. The folly and madness of Charles and his followers, in
  risking a battle on such ground, with jaded, unequal forces,
  half-starved, and deprived of rest the preceding night, has often
  been remarked, and is at one glance perceived by the spectator. The
  Royalist artillery and cavalry had full room to play, for not a knoll
  or bush was there to mar their murderous aim. Mountains and
  fastnesses were on the right, within a couple of hours&#39; journey,
  but a fatality had struck the infatuated bands of Charles; dissension
  and discord were in his councils; and a power greater than that of
  Cumberland had marked them for destruction. But a truce to politics;
  the grave has closed over victors and vanquished:</p>

  <div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
    <p>&quot;Culloden&#39;s dread echoes are hush&#39;d on the
    moors;&quot;</p>
  </div></div>

  <p>and who would awaken them with the voice of reproach, uttered over
  the dust of the slain? The most interesting memorials of the contest
  are the green grassy mounds which mark the graves of the slain
  Highlanders, and which are at once distinguished from the black heath
  around by the freshness and richness of their verdure. One large pit
  received the Frasers, and another was dug for the Macintoshes.</p>

  <h2>ATHENS.</h2>

  <p>The most striking object in Athens is the Acropolis, or
  Citadel&mdash;a rock which rises abruptly from the plain, and is
  crowned with the Parthenon. This was a temple dedicated to the
  goddess Minerva, and was built of the hard white marble of
  Pentelicus. It suffered from the ravages of war between the Turks and
  Venetians, and also more recently in our own time. The remnant of the
  sculptures which decorated the pediments, with a large part of the
  frieze, and other interesting remains, are now in what is called the
  Elgin collection of the British Museum. During the embassy of Lord
  Elgin at Constantinople, he obtained permission from the Turkish
  government to proceed to Athens for the purpose of procuring casts
  from the most celebrated remains of sculpture and architecture which
  still existed at Athens. Besides models and drawings which he made,
  his Lordship collected numerous pieces of Athenian sculpture in
  statues, capitals, cornices, &amp;c., and these he very generously
  presented to the English Government, thus forming a school of Grecian
  art in London, to which there does not at present exist a parallel.
  In making this collection he was stimulated by seeing the destruction
  into which these remains were sinking, through the influence of
  Turkish barbarism. Some fine statues in the Parthenon had been
  pounded down for mortar, on account of their affording the whitest
  marble within reach, and this mortar was employed in the construction
  of miserable huts. At one period the Parthenon was converted into a
  powder magazine by the Turks, and in consequence suffered severely
  from an explosion in 1656, which carried away the roof of the right
  wing.</p><!-- [Illustration: ATHENS.] -->

  <p>At the close of the late Greek war Athens was in a dreadful state,
  being little more than a heap of ruins. It was declared by a Royal
  ordinance of 1834 to be the capital of the new kingdom of Greece, and
  in the March of that year the King laid the foundation-stone of his
  palace there. In the hill of Areopagus, where sat that famous
  tribunal, we may still discover the steps cut in the rock by which it
  was ascended, the seats of the judges, and opposite to them those of
  the accuser and accused. This hill was converted into a burial-place
  for the Turks, and is covered with their tombs.</p>

  <h2>THE SIEGE OF ANTIOCH.</h2><!-- [Illustration: Letter B] -->

  <div class="decoration">

  </div>

  <p>Baghasihan, the Turkish Prince, or Emir of Antioch, had under his
  command an Armenian of the name of Phirouz, whom he had entrusted
  with the defence of a tower on that part of the city wall which
  overlooked the passes of the mountains. Bohemund, by means of a spy,
  who had embraced the Christian religion, and to whom he had given his
  own name at baptism, kept up a daily communication with this captain,
  and made him the most magnificent promises of reward if he would
  deliver up his post to the Crusaders. Whether the proposal was first
  made by Bohemund or by the Armenian, is uncertain, but that a good
  understanding soon existed between them is undoubted; and a night was
  fixed for the execution of the project. Bohemund communicated the
  scheme to Godfrey and the Count of Toulouse, with the stipulation
  that, if the city were won, he, as the soul of the enterprise, should
  enjoy the dignity of Prince of Antioch. The other leaders hesitated:
  ambition and jealousy prompted them to refuse their aid in furthering
  the views of the intriguer. More mature consideration decided them to
  acquiesce, and seven hundred of the bravest knights were chosen for
  the expedition, the real object of which, for fear of spies, was kept
  a profound secret from the rest of the army.</p>
  <!-- [Illustration: ANTIOCH.] -->

  <div class="illustration">
    <a name="image-0119"></a> <img src="img/0119.jpg" alt="Antioch.">
  </div>

  <p>Everything favoured the treacherous project of the Armenian
  captain, who, on his solitary watch-tower, received due intimation of
  the approach of the Crusaders. The night was dark and stormy: not a
  star was visible above; and the wind howled so furiously as to
  overpower all other sounds. The rain fell in torrents, and the
  watchers on the towers adjoining to that of Phirouz could not hear
  the tramp of the armed knights for the wind, nor see them for the
  obscurity of the night and the dismalness of the weather. When within
  bow-shot of the walls, Bohemund sent forward an interpreter to confer
  with the Armenian. The latter urged them to make haste and seize the
  favourable interval, as armed men, with lighted torches, patrolled
  the battlements every half-hour, and at that instant they had just
  passed. The chiefs were instantly at the foot of the wall. Phirouz
  let down a rope; Bohemund attached to it a ladder of hides, which was
  then raised by the Armenian, and held while the knights mounted. A
  momentary fear came over the spirits of the adventurers, and every
  one hesitated; at last Bohemund, encouraged by Phirouz from above,
  ascended a few steps on the ladder, and was followed by Godfrey,
  Count Robert of Flanders, and a number of other knights. As they
  advanced, others pressed forward, until their weight became too great
  for the ladder, which, breaking, precipitated about a dozen of them
  to the ground, where they fell one upon the other, making a great
  clatter with their heavy coats of mail. For a moment they thought all
  was lost; but the wind made so loud a howling, as it swept in fierce
  gusts through the mountain gorges, and the Orontes, swollen by the
  rain, rushed so noisily along, that the guards heard nothing. The
  ladder was easily repaired, and the knights ascended, two at a time,
  and reached the platform in safety. When sixty of them had thus
  ascended, the torch of the coming patrol was seen to gleam at the
  angle of the wall. Hiding themselves behind a buttress, they awaited
  his coming in breathless silence. As soon as he arrived at arm&#39;s
  length, he was suddenly seized; and before he could open his lips to
  raise an alarm, the silence of death closed them up for ever. They
  next descended rapidly the spiral staircase of the tower, and,
  opening the portal, admitted the whole of their companions. Raymond
  of Toulouse, who, cognizant of the whole plan, had been left behind
  with the main body of the army, heard at this instant the signal
  horn, which announced that an entry had been effected, and advancing
  with his legions, the town was attacked from within and from
  without.</p>

  <p>Imagination cannot conceive a scene more dreadful than that
  presented by the devoted city of Antioch on that night of horror. The
  Crusaders fought with a blind fury, which fanaticism and suffering
  alike incited. Men, women, and children were indiscriminately
  slaughtered, till the streets ran in gore. Darkness increased the
  destruction; for, when the morning dawned the Crusaders found
  themselves with their swords at the breasts of their fellow-soldiers,
  whom they had mistaken to be foes. The Turkish commander fled, first
  to the citadel, and, that becoming insecure, to the mountains,
  whither he was pursued and slain, and his gory head brought back to
  Antioch as a trophy. At daylight the massacre ceased, and the
  Crusaders gave themselves up to plunder.</p>

  <h2>RISE OF POETRY AMONG THE ROMANS.</h2>

  <p>The Romans, in the infancy of their state, were entirely rude and
  unpolished. They came from shepherds; they were increased from the
  refuse of the nations around them; and their manners agreed with
  their original. As they lived wholly on tilling their ground at home,
  or on plunder from their neighbours, war was their business, and
  agriculture the chief art they followed. Long after this, when they
  had spread their conquests over a great part of Italy, and began to
  make a considerable figure in the world&mdash;even their great men
  retained a roughness, which they raised into a virtue, by calling it
  Roman spirit; and which might often much better have been called
  Roman barbarity. It seems to me, that there was more of austerity
  than justice, and more of insolence than courage, in some of their
  most celebrated actions. However that be, this is certain, that they
  were at first a nation of soldiers and husbandmen: roughness was long
  an applauded character among them; and a sort of rusticity reigned,
  even in their senate-house.</p>
  <!-- [Illustration: ANCIENT ROMAN CENTURION.] -->

  <div class="illustration">
    <a name="image-0123"></a> <img src="img/0123.jpg" alt=
    "Ancient Roman Centurion.">
  </div>

  <p>In a nation originally of such a temper as this, taken up almost
  always in extending their territories, very often in settling the
  balance of power among themselves, and not unfrequently in both these
  at the same time, it was long before the politer arts made any
  appearance; and very long before they took root or flourished to any
  degree. Poetry was the first that did so; but such a poetry as one
  might expect among a warlike, busied, unpolished people.</p>

  <p>Not to enquire about the songs of triumph mentioned even in
  Romulus&#39;s time, there was certainly something of poetry among
  them in the next reign, under Numa; a Prince who pretended to
  converse with the Muses as well as with Egeria, and who might
  possibly himself have made the verses which the Salian priests sang
  in his time. Pythagoras, either in the same reign, or if you please
  some time after, gave the Romans a tincture of poetry as well as of
  philosophy; for Cicero assures us that the Pythagoreans made great
  use of poetry and music; and probably they, like our old Druids,
  delivered most of their precepts in verse. Indeed, the chief
  employment of poetry in that and the following ages, among the
  Romans, was of a religious kind. Their very prayers, and perhaps
  their whole liturgy, was poetical. They had also a sort of prophetic
  or sacred writers, who seem to have written generally in verse; and
  were so numerous that there were above two thousand of their volumes
  remaining even to Augustus&#39;s time. They had a kind of plays too,
  in these early times, derived from what they had seen of the Tuscan
  actors when sent for to Rome to expiate a plague that raged in the
  city. These seem to have been either like our dumb-shows, or else a
  kind of extempore farces&mdash;a thing to this day a good deal in use
  all over Italy and in Tuscany. In a more particular manner, add to
  these that extempore kind of jesting dialogues begun at their harvest
  and vintage feasts, and carried on so rudely and abusively afterwards
  as to occasion a very severe law to restrain their licentiousness;
  and those lovers of poetry and good eating, who seem to have attended
  the tables of the richer sort, much like the old provincial poets, or
  our own British bards, and sang there to some instrument of music the
  achievements of their ancestors, and the noble deeds of those who had
  gone before them, to inflame others to follow their great
  examples.</p>

    "Ancient Roman Torches.">
  </div>

  <p>The names of almost all these poets sleep in peace with all their
  works; and, if we may take the word of the other Roman writers of a
  better age, it is no great loss to us. One of their best poets
  represents them as very obscure and very contemptible; one of their
  best historians avoids quoting them as too barbarous for politer
  ears; and one of their most judicious emperors ordered the greatest
  part of their writings to be burnt, that the world might be troubled
  with them no longer.</p>

    "Ancient Alabaster Box.">
  </div>

  <p>All these poets, therefore, may very well be dropped in the
  account, there being nothing remaining of their works, and probably
  no merit to be found in them if they had remained. And so we may date
  the beginning of the Roman poetry from Livius Andronicus, the first
  of their poets of whom anything does remain to us; and from whom the
  Romans themselves seem to have dated the beginning of their poetry,
  even in the Augustan age.</p>

    "Ancient Roman Mill.">
  </div>

  <p>The first kind of poetry that was followed with any success among
  the Romans, was that for the stage. They were a very religious
  people; and stage plays in those times made no inconsiderable part in
  their public devotions; it is hence, perhaps, that the greatest
  number of their oldest poets, of whom we have any remains, and,
  indeed, almost all of them, are dramatic poets.</p>

  <h2>CHARACTER OF JULIUS CAESAR.</h2><!-- [Illustration: Letter C] -->

  <p>Caesar was endowed with every great and noble quality that could
  exalt human nature, and give a man the ascendant in society. Formed
  to excel in peace as well as war; provident in council; fearless in
  action, and executing what he had resolved with an amazing celerity;
  generous beyond measure to his friends; placable to his enemies; and
  for parts, learning, and eloquence, scarce inferior to any man. His
  orations were admired for two qualities, which are seldom found
  together, strength and elegance: Cicero ranks him among the greatest
  orators that Rome ever bred; and Quintilian says, that he spoke with
  the same force with which he fought; and if he had devoted himself to
  the bar, would have been the only man capable of rivalling Cicero.
  Nor was he a master only of the politer arts; but conversant also
  with the most abstruse and critical parts of learning; and, among
  other works which he published, addressed two books to Cicero on the
  analogy of language, or the art of speaking and writing correctly. He
  was a most liberal patron of wit and learning, wheresoever they were
  found; and out of his love of those talents, would readily pardon
  those who had employed them against himself; rightly judging, that by
  making such men his friends, he should draw praises from the same
  fountain from which he had been aspersed. His capital passions were
  ambition and love of pleasure, which he indulged in their turns to
  the greatest excess; yet the first was always predominant&mdash;to
  which he could easily sacrifice all the charms of the second, and
  draw pleasure even from toils and dangers, when they ministered to
  his glory. For he thought Tyranny, as Cicero says, the greatest of
  goddesses; and had frequently in his mouth a verse of Euripides,
  which expressed the image of his soul, that if right and justice were
  ever to be violated, they were to be violated for the sake of
  reigning. This was the chief end and purpose of his life&mdash;the
  scheme that he had formed from his early youth; so that, as Cato
  truly declared of him, he came with sobriety and meditation to the
  subversion of the republic. He used to say, that there were two
  things necessary to acquire and to support power&mdash;soldiers and
  money; which yet depended mutually upon each other: with money,
  therefore, he provided soldiers, and with soldiers extorted money,
  and was, of all men, the most rapacious in plundering both friends
  and foes; sparing neither prince, nor state, nor temple, nor even
  private persons who were known to possess any share of treasure. His
  great abilities would necessarily have made him one of the first
  citizens of Rome; but, disdaining the condition of a subject, he
  could never rest till he made himself a Monarch. In acting this last
  part, his usual prudence seemed to fail him; as if the height to
  which he was mounted had turned his head and made him giddy; for, by
  a vain ostentation of his power, he destroyed the stability of it;
  and, as men shorten life by living too fast, so by an intemperance of
  reigning he brought his reign to a violent end.</p>

  out. He besieged that city seven months, during which time he erected
  vast mounds of earth, plied it with his engines, and invested it on
  the side next the sea with two hundred gallies. He had a dream in
  which he saw Hercules offering him his hand from the wall, and
  inviting him to enter; and many of the Tyrians dreamt &quot;that
  Apollo declared he would go over to Alexander, because he was
  displeased with their behaviour in the town,&quot; Hereupon, the
  Tyrians, as if the God had been a deserter taken in the fact, loaded
  his statue with chains, and nailed the feet to the pedestal, not
  scrupling to call him an <i>Alexandrist</i>. In another dream,
  Alexander thought he saw a satyr playing before him at some distance,
  and when he advanced to take him, the savage eluded his grasp.
  However, at last, after much coaxing and taking many circuits round
  him, be prevailed with him to surrender himself. The interpreters,
  plausibly enough, divided the Greek name for <i>satyr</i> into two,
  <i>Sa Tyros</i>, which signifies <i>Tyre is thine</i>. They still
  show us a fountain near which Alexander is said to have seen that
  vision.</p><!-- [Illustration: CITY OF TYRE.] -->

  <p>About the middle of the siege, he made an excursion against the
  Arabians who dwelt about Anti-Libanus. Here he ran a great risk of
  his life, on account of his preceptor Lysimachus, who insisted on
  attending him&mdash;being, as he alleged, neither older nor less
  valiant than Phoenix; but when they came to the hills and quitted
  their horses to march up on foot, the rest of the party got far
  before Alexander and Lysimachus. Night came on, and, as the enemy was
  at no great distance, the King would not leave his preceptor, borne
  down with fatigue and with the weight of years. Therefore, while he
  was encouraging and helping him forward, he was insensibly separated
  from the troop, and had a cold and dark night to pass in an exposed
  and dismal situation. In this perplexity, he observed at a distance a
  number of scattered fires which the enemy had lighted; and depending
  upon his swiftness and activity as well as being accustomed to
  extricate the Macedonians out of every difficulty, by taking a share
  in the labour and danger, he ran to the next fire. After having
  killed two of the barbarians who watched it, he seized a lighted
  brand and hastened with it to his party, who soon kindled a great
  fire. The sight of this so intimidated the enemy, that many of them
  fled, and those who ventured to attack him were repulsed with
  considerable slaughter. By this means he passed the night in safety,
  according to the account we have from Charis.</p>

  <p>As for the siege, it was brought to a termination in this manner:
  Alexander had permitted his main body to repose themselves after the
  long and severe fatigues they had undergone, and ordered only some
  small parties to keep the Tyrians in play. In the meantime,
  Aristander, his principal soothsayer, offered sacrifices; and one
  day, upon inspecting the entrails of the victim, he boldly asserted
  among those around him that the city would certainly be taken that
  month. As it happened to be the last day of that month, his assertion
  was received with ridicule and scorn. The King perceiving he was
  disconcerted, and making it a point to bring the prophecies of his
  minister to completion, gave orders that the day should not be called
  the 30th, but the 28th of the month; at the same time he called out
  his forces by sound of trumpet, and made a much more vigorous assault
  than he at first intended. The attack was violent, and those who were
  left behind in the camp quitted it, to have a share in it and to
  support their fellow-soldiers, insomuch that the Tyrians were forced
  to give out, and the city was taken that very day.</p>

  <p>The river Niagara takes its rise in the western extremity of Lake
  Erie, and, after flowing about thirty-four miles, empties itself into
  Lake Ontario. It is from half a mile to three miles broad; its course
  is very smooth, and its depth considerable. The sides above the
  cataract are nearly level; but below the falls, the stream rushes
  between very lofty rocks, crowned by gigantic trees. The great body
  of water does not fall in one complete sheet, but is separated by
  islands, and forms three distinct falls. One of these, called the
  Great Fall, or, from its shape, the Horse-shoe Fall, is on the
  Canadian side. Its beauty is considered to surpass that of the
  others, although its height is considerably less. It is said to have
  a fall of 165 feet; and in the inn, which is about 300 yards from the
  fall, the concussion of air caused by this immense cataract is so
  great, that the window-frames, and, indeed, the whole house, are
  continually in a tremulous motion, and in winter, when the wind
  drives the spray in the direction of the buildings, the whole scene
  is coated with sheets of ice.</p>

  <p>The great cataract is seen by few travellers in its winter garb. I
  had seen it several years before in all the glories of autumn, its
  encircling woods, happily spared by the remorseless hatchet, and
  tinted with the brilliant hues peculiar to the American
  &quot;Fall.&quot; Now the glory had departed; the woods were still
  there, but were generally black, with occasional green pines; beneath
  the grey trunks was spread a thick mantle of snow, and from the brown
  rocks inclosing the deep channel of the Niagara River hung huge
  clusters of icicles, twenty feet in length, like silver pipes of
  giant organs. The tumultuous rapids appeared to descend more
  regularly than formerly over the steps which distinctly extended
  across the wide river. The portions of the British, or Horse-shoe
  Fall, where the waters descend in masses of snowy whiteness, were
  unchanged by the season, except that vast sheets of ice and icicles
  hung on their margin; but where the deep waves of sea-green water
  roll majestically over the steep, large pieces of descending ice were
  frequently descried on its surface. No rainbows were now observed on
  the great vapour-cloud which shrouds for ever the bottom of the Fall;
  but we were extremely fortunate to see now plainly what I had looked
  for in vain at my last visit, the <i>water-rockets</i>, first
  described by Captain Hall, which shot up with a train of vapour
  singly, and in flights of a dozen, from the abyss near Table Rock,
  curved towards the east, and burst and fell in front of the cataract.
  Vast masses of descending fluid produce this singular effect, by
  means of condensed air acting on portions of the vapour into which
  the water is comminuted below. Altogether the appearance was most
  startling. It was observed at 1 P.M. from the gallery of Mr.
  Barnett&#39;s museum. The broad sheet of the American Fall presented
  the appearance of light-green water and feathery spray, also margined
  by huge icicles. As in summer, the water rushing from under the
  vapour-cloud of the two Falls was of a milky whiteness as far as the
  ferry, when it became dark and interspersed with floating masses of
  ice. Here, the year before, from the pieces of ice being heaped and
  crushed together in great quantities, was formed a thick and high
  bridge of ice, completely across the river, safe for passengers for
  some time; and in the middle of it a Yankee speculator had erected a
  shanty for refreshments. Lately, at a dinner party, I heard a
  staff-officer of talent, but who was fond of exciting wonder by his
  narratives, propose to the company a singular wager,&mdash;a bet of
  one hundred pounds that he would go over the Falls of Niagara and
  come out alive at the bottom! No one being inclined to take him up,
  after a good deal of discussion as to how this perilous feat was to
  be accomplished, the plan was disclosed. To place on Table Rock a
  crane, with a long arm reaching over the water of the Horse-shoe
  Fall; from this arm would hang, by a stout rope, a large bucket or
  cask; this would be taken up some distance above the Fall, where the
  mill-race slowly glides towards the cataract; here the adventurer
  would get into the cask, men stationed on the Table Rock would haul
  in the slack of the rope as he descended, and the crane would swing
  him clear from the cataract as he passed over. Here is a chance for
  any gentleman sportsman to immortalize himself!</p>

  <h2>THE SLOTH.</h2><!-- [Illustration] -->

  <div class="illustration">
    <a name="image-0131"></a> <img src="img/0131.jpg" alt="The Sloth.">
  </div>

  <p>The Sloth, in its wild condition, spends its whole life on the
  trees, and never leaves them but through force or accident; and, what
  is more extraordinary, it lives not <i>upon</i> the branches, like
  the squirrel and the monkey, but <i>under</i> them. Suspended from
  the branches, it moves, and rests, and sleeps. So much of its
  anatomical structure as illustrates this peculiarity it is necessary
  to state. The arm and fore-arm of the sloth, taken together, are
  nearly twice the length of the hind legs; and they are, both by their
  form and the manner in which they are joined to the body, quite
  incapacitated from acting in a perpendicular direction, or in
  supporting it upon the earth, as the bodies of other quadrupeds are
  supported by their legs. Hence, if the animal be placed on the floor,
  its belly touches the ground. The wrist and ankle are joined to the
  fore-arm and leg in an oblique direction; so that the palm or sole,
  instead of being directed downwards towards the surface of the
  ground, as in other animals, is turned inward towards the body, in
  such a manner that it is impossible for the sloth to place the sole
  of its foot flat down upon a level surface. It is compelled, under
  such circumstances, to rest upon the external edge of the foot. This,
  joined to other peculiarities in the formation, render it impossible
  for sloths to walk after the manner of ordinary quadrupeds; and it is
  indeed only on broken ground, when he can lay hold of stones, roots
  of grass, &amp;c., that he can get along at all. He then extends his
  arms in all directions in search of something to lay hold of; and
  when he has succeeded, he pulls himself forward, and is then enabled
  to trail himself along in the exceedingly awkward and tardy manner
  which has procured for him his name.</p>

  <p>Mr. Waterton informs us that he kept a sloth for several months in
  his room, in order to have an opportunity of observing his motions.
  If the ground were rough he would pull himself forward in the manner
  described, at a pretty good pace; and he invariably directed his
  course towards the nearest tree. But if he was placed upon a smooth
  and well-trodden part of the road, he appeared to be in much
  distress. Within doors, the favourite position of this sloth was on
  the back of a chair; and after getting all his legs in a line on the
  topmost part of it, he would hang there for hours together, and often
  with a low and plaintive cry would seem to invite the notice of his
  master. The sloth does not suspend himself head downward, like the
  vampire bat, but when asleep he supports himself from a branch
  parallel to the earth. He first seizes the branch with one arm, and
  then with the other; after which he brings up both his legs, one by
  one, to the same branch; so that, as in the Engraving, all the four
  limbs are in a line. In this attitude the sloth has the power of
  using the fore paw as a hand in conveying food to his mouth, which he
  does with great address, retaining meanwhile a firm hold of the
  branch with the other three paws. In all his operations the enormous
  claws with which the sloth is provided are of indispensable service.
  They are so sharp and crooked that they readily seize upon the
  smallest inequalities in the bark of the trees and branches, among
  which the animal usually resides, and also form very powerful weapons
  of defence.</p>

  <p>The sloth has been said to confine himself to one tree until he
  has completely stripped it of its leaves; but Mr. Waterton says,
  &quot;During the many years I have ranged the forests, I have never
  seen a tree in such a state of nudity; indeed, I would hazard a
  conjecture, that, by the time the animal had finished the last of the
  old leaves, there would be a new crop on the part of the tree it had
  stripped first, ready for him to begin again&mdash;so quick is the
  process of vegetation in these countries. There is a saying among the
  Indians, that when the wind blows the sloth begins to travel. In calm
  weather he remains tranquil, probably not liking to cling to the
  brittle extremities of the branches, lest they should break with him
  in passing from one tree to another; but as soon as the wind arises,
  and the branches of the neighbouring trees become interwoven, the
  sloth then seizes hold of them and travels at such a good round pace,
  that any one seeing him, as I have done, pass from tree to tree,
  would never think of calling him a sloth.&quot;</p>

  <h2>SIERRA NEVADA, OR SNOWY RANGE OF CALIFORNIA.</h2>

  <p>&quot;The dividing ridge of the Sierra Nevada is in sight from
  this encampment. Accompanied by Mr. Preuss, I ascended to-day the
  highest peak to the right, from which we had a beautiful view of a
  mountain lake at our feet, about 15 miles in length, and so entirely
  surrounded by mountains that we could not discover an outlet. We had
  taken with us a glass, but though we enjoyed an extended view, the
  valley was half hidden in mist, as when we had seen it before. Snow
  could be distinguished on the higher parts of the coast mountains;
  eastward, as far as the eye could extend, it ranged over a terrible
  mass of broken snowy mountains, fading off blue in the distance. The
  rock composing the summit consists of a very coarse, dark, volcanic
  conglomerate: the lower parts appeared to be of a very slatey
  structure. The highest trees were a few scattered cedars and aspens.
  From the immediate foot of the peak we were two hours in reaching the
  summit, and one hour and a quarter in descending. The day had been
  very bright, still, and clear, and spring seems to be advancing
  rapidly. While the sun is in the sky the snow melts rapidly, and
  gushing springs cover the face of the mountain in all the exposed
  places, but their surface freezes instantly with the disappearance of
  the sun.</p>

  <p>&quot;The Indians of the Sierra make frequent descents upon the
  settlements west of the Coast Range, which they keep constantly swept
  of horses; among them are many who are called Christian Indians,
  being refugees from Spanish missions. Several of these incursions
  occurred while we were at Helvetia. Occasionally parties of soldiers
  follow them across the Coast Range, but never enter the
  Sierra.&quot;</p><!-- [Illustration: SIERRA NEVADA, UPPER CALIFORNIA] -->

  <p>The party had not long before passed through a beautiful country.
  The narrative says:&mdash;&quot;During the earlier part of the day
  our ride had been over a very level prairie, or rather a succession
  of long stretches of prairie, separated by lines and groves of oak
  timber, growing along dry gullies, which are tilled with water in
  seasons of rain; and perhaps, also, by the melting snows. Over much
  of this extent the vegetation was spare; the surface showing plainly
  the action of water, which, in the season of flood, the Joaquin
  spreads over the valley. About one o&#39;clock, we came again among
  innumerable flowers; and, a few miles further, fields of beautiful
  blue-flowering <i>lupine</i>, which seems to love the neighbourhood
  of water, indicated that we were approaching a stream. We here found
  this beautiful shrub in thickets, some of them being twelve feet in
  height. Occasionally, three or four plants were clustered together,
  forming a grand bouquet, about ninety feet in circumference, and ten
  feet high; the whole summit covered with spikes of flowers, the
  perfume of which is very sweet and grateful. A lover of natural
  beauty can imagine with what pleasure we rode among these flowering
  groves, which filled the air with a light and delicate fragrance. We
  continued our road for about half a mile, interspersed through an
  open grove of live oaks, which, in form, were the most symmetrical
  and beautiful we had yet seen in this country. The ends of their
  branches rested on the ground, forming somewhat more than a half
  sphere of very full and regular figure, with leaves apparently
  smaller than usual. The Californian poppy, of a rich orange colour,
  was numerous to-day. Elk and several bands of antelope made their
  appearance. Our road now was one continued enjoyment; and it was
  pleasant riding among this assemblage of green pastures, with varied
  flowers and scattered groves, and, out of the warm, green spring, to
  look at the rocky and snowy peaks where lately we had suffered so
  much.&quot;</p>

  <p>Again, in the Sierra Nevada:&mdash;&quot;Our journey to-day was in
  the midst of an advanced spring, whose green and floral beauty
  offered a delightful contrast to the sandy valley we had just left.
  All the day snow was in sight on the butt of the mountain, which
  frowned down upon us on the right; but we beheld it now with feelings
  of pleasant security, as we rode along between green trees and on
  flowers, with humming-birds and other feathered friends of the
  traveller enlivening the serene spring air. As we reached the summit
  of this beautiful pass, and obtained a view into the eastern country,
  we saw at once that here was the place to take leave of all such
  pleasant scenes as those around us. The distant mountains were now
  bald rocks again; and, below, the land had any colour but green.
  Taking into consideration the nature of the Sierra Nevada, we found
  this pass an excellent one for horses; and, with a little labour, or,
  perhaps, with a more perfect examination of the localities, it might
  be made sufficiently practicable for waggons.&quot;</p>

  <p>We have but few European birds presenting more points of interest
  in their history than the Grouse, a species peculiar to the northern
  and temperate latitudes of the globe. Dense pine forests are the
  abode of some; others frequent the wild tracts of heath-clad
  moorland, while the patches of vegetation scattered among the rocky
  peaks of the mountains, afford a congenial residence to others.
  Patient of cold, and protected during the intense severities of
  winter by their thick plumage, they give animation to the frozen
  solitude long after all other birds have retired from the desolate
  scenery. Their food consists of the tender shoots of pines, the seeds
  of plants, the berries of the arbutus and bilberry, the buds of the
  birch and alder, the buds of the heather, leaves, and grain. The nest
  is very simply constructed, consisting of dried grasses placed upon
  the ground and sheltered among the herbage.</p>

  <p>Two species of this bird, called forest grouse, are indigenous in
  England: one is the black grouse, common in the pine woods of
  Scotland and of the northern part of England, and elsewhere; the
  other is the capercailzie or cock of the woods. Formerly, in Ireland,
  and still more recently in Scotland, this noble bird, the most
  magnificent of the whole of the grouse tribe, was abundant in the
  larger woods; but it gradually disappeared, from the indiscriminate
  slaughter to which it was subject. Selby informs us that the last
  individual of this species in Scotland was killed about forty years
  ago, near Inverness. It still abounds in the pine forests of Sweden
  and Norway, and an attempt has been made by the Marquis of
  Breadalbane to re-introduce it into Scotland.</p>

  <p>The red grouse, or moor grouse, is found in Scotland; and it is
  somewhat singular that this beautiful bird should not be known on the
  Continent, abundant as it is on the moorlands of Scotland, England,
  and Ireland. The breeding season of the red grouse is very early in
  spring, and the female deposits her eggs, eight or ten in number, in
  a high tuft of heather. The eggs are peculiarly beautiful, of a rich
  brown colour, spotted with black, and both herself and her mate
  attend the young with great assiduity. The brood continue in company
  during the winter, and often unite with other broods, forming large
  packs, which range the high moorlands, being usually shy and
  difficult of approach. Various berries, such as the cranberry, the
  bilberry, together with the tender shoots of heath, constitute the
  food of this species. The plumage is a rich colouring of chestnut,
  barred with black. The cock grouse in October is a very handsome
  bird, with his bright red comb erected above his eyes, and his fine
  brown plumage shining in the sun.</p><!-- [Illustration: GROUSE.] -->

  <p>The ptarmigan grouse is not only a native of Scotland but of the
  higher latitudes of continental Europe, and, perhaps, the changes of
  plumage in none of the feathered races are more remarkable than those
  which the ptarmigans undergo. Their full summer plumage is yellow,
  more or less inclining to brown, beautifully barred with zig-zag
  lines of black. Their winter dress is pure white, except that the
  outer tail-feathers, the shafts of the quills, and a streak from the
  eye to the beak are black. This singular change of plumage enables
  it, when the mountains are covered with snow, to escape the
  observation of the eagle, Iceland falcon, and the snowy owl: the
  feathers become much fuller, thicker, and more downy; the bill is
  almost hidden, and the legs become so thickly covered with hair-like
  feathers, as to resemble the legs of some well-furred quadruped.</p>

  <p>Patmos affords one of the few exceptions which are to be found to
  the general beauty and fertility of the islands of the Aegean Sea.
  Its natural advantages, indeed, are very few, for the whole of the
  island is little else than one continued rock, rising frequently into
  hills and mountains. Its valleys are seldom susceptible of
  cultivation, and scarcely ever reward it. Almost the only spot,
  indeed, in which it has been attempted, is a small valley in the
  west, where the richer inhabitants have a few gardens. On account of
  its stern and desolate character, the island was used, under the
  Roman Empire, as a place of banishment; and here the Apostle St.
  John, during the persecution of Domitian, was banished, and wrote the
  book of the Revela tions. The island now bears the name of Patino and
  Palmosa, but a natural grotto in the rock is still shown as the place
  where St. John resided. &quot;In and around it,&quot; says Mr.
  Turner, &quot;the Greeks have dressed up one of their tawdry
  churches; and on the same site is a school attached to the church, in
  which a few children are taught reading and writing.&quot;</p>

  </div>

  <p>Patmos used to be a famous resort of pirates. Dr. Clarke, after
  describing with enthusiasm the splendid scene which he witnessed in
  passing by Patmos, with feelings naturally excited by all the
  circumstances of local solemnity, and &quot;the evening sun behind
  the towering cliffs of Patmos, gilding the battlements of the
  Monastery of the Apocalypse with its parting rays; the consecrated
  island, surrounded by inexpressible brightness, seeming to float upon
  an abyss of fire, while the moon, in milder splendour, was rising
  full over the opposite expanse,&quot; proceeds to remark, &quot;How
  very different were the reflections caused upon leaving the deck, by
  observing a sailor with a lighted match in his hand, and our captain
  busied in appointing an extraordinary watch for the night, as a
  precaution against the pirates who swarm in these seas.&quot; These
  wretches, as dastardly as they were cruel, the instant they boarded a
  vessel, put every individual of the crew to death. They lurked about
  the isle of Fouri, to the north of Patmos, in great numbers, taking
  possession of bays and creeks the least frequented by other mariners.
  After they had plundered a ship, they bored a hole through her
  bottom, and took to their boats again. The knights of Malta were said
  to be amongst the worst of these robbers. In the library of the
  Monastery, which is built on the top of a mountain, and in the middle
  of the chief town, may be seen bulls from two of the Popes, and a
  protection from the Emperor Charles the Sixth, issued to protect the
  island from their incursions.</p>

  <p>Though deficient in trees, Patmos now abounds in flowering plants
  and shrubs. Walnuts and other fruit trees grow in the orchards; and
  the wine of Patmos is the strongest and best flavoured of any in the
  Greek islands. The view of Patmos from the highest point is said to
  be very curious. The eye looks down on nothing but mountains below
  it; and the excessive narrowness of the island, with the curious form
  of its coast, have an extraordinary appearance.</p>

  <p>Memorable in the history of genius is the 23rd of April, as being
  at once the day of the birth and death of Shakspeare; and these
  events took place on the same spot, for at Stratford-upon-Avon this
  illustrious dramatist was born, in the year 1564, and here he also
  died, in 1616. It has been conjectured, that his first dramatic
  composition was produced when he was but twenty-five years old. He
  continued to write for the stage for a great number of years;
  occasionally, also, appearing as a performer: and at length, having,
  by his exertions, secured a fortune of two or three hundred a year,
  retired to his native town, where he purchased a small estate, and
  spent the remainder of his days in ease and honour.</p>

  <p>When Washington Irving visited Stratford-upon-Avon, he was led to
  make the following elegant reflections on the return of the poet to
  his early home:&mdash;&quot;He who has sought renown about the world,
  and has reaped a full harvest of worldly favours, will find, after
  all, that there is no love, no admiration, no applause, so sweet to
  the soul as that which springs up in his native place. It is there
  that he seeks to be gathered in peace and honour among his kindred
  and his early friends. And when the weary heart and failing head
  begin to warn him that the evening of life is drawing on, he turns as
  fondly as does the infant to the mother&#39;s arms, to sink in sleep
  in the bosom of the scene of his childhood. How would it have cheered
  the spirit of the youthful bard, when, wandering forth in disgrace
  upon a doubtful world, he cast a heavy look upon his pastoral home,
  could he have foreseen that, before many years, he should return to
  it covered with renown; that his name should become the boast and
  glory of his native place; that his ashes should be religiously
  guarded as its most precious treasure; and that its lessening spire,
  on which his eyes were fixed in tearful contemplation, should one day
  become the beacon, towering amidst the gentle landscape, to guide the
  literary pilgrim of every nation to his tomb!&quot;</p>

  <p>The accredited birth-place of Shakspeare has always been regarded
  with great interest: it is situate in a street in Stratford,
  retaining its ancient name of Henley, being the road to
  Henley-in-Arden. In 1574, here stood two houses, with a garden and
  orchard attached to each; and these houses were then purchased by
  John Shakspeare, whose son William was born in one of them, which
  still remains, though altered according to modern fashion. Its gable
  roofs are destroyed. Divided and subdivided into smaller tenements,
  part was converted into a little inn; part, the residence of a female
  who formerly showed the room where Shakspeare first saw the light,
  and the low-roofed kitchen where his mother taught him to read. The
  walls of the room in which he was born are literally covered with
  thousands of names, inscribed in homage by pilgrims from every region
  where the glory of Shakspeare is known. At the time when
  Shakspeare&#39;s father bought this house, it was, no doubt, quite a
  mansion, as compared with the majority of the houses in Stratford;
  but he little guessed the fame that would attach itself to this
  birth-place of his gifted son; long, we trust, to be preserved for
  the gratification of future generations of visitors to the hallowed
  spot. Besides his plays, Shakspeare was the author of several other
  poetical productions, and especially of a collection of sonnets.</p>

  <h2>COBRA DI CAPELLO&mdash;HOODED SNAKE.</h2>

  <p>There are several varieties of this venomous serpent, differing in
  point of colour; and the aspic of Egypt, with which Cleopatra
  destroyed herself, is said to be a very near ally to this species;
  but the true cobra is entirely confined to India.</p>

  <p>The danger which accompanies the bite of this reptile, its
  activity when excited, the singularity of its form, and the
  gracefulness of its action, combine to render it one of the most
  remarkable animals of the class to which it belongs. When in its
  ordinary state of repose the neck is of the same diameter as the
  head; but when surprised or irritated, the skin expands laterally in
  a hood-like form, which is well known to the inhabitants of India as
  the symptom of approaching danger. Notwithstanding the fatal effects
  of the bite of these serpents, the Indian jugglers are not deterred
  from capturing and taming them for exhibition, which they do with
  singular adroitness, and with fearful interest to the unpractised
  observer. They carry the reptiles from house to house in a small
  round basket, from which they issue at the sound of a sort of flute,
  and execute certain movements in cadence with the music.</p>

  <p>The animal from which our Engraving was taken is now in the
  menagerie of the Zoological Society in the Regent&#39;s Park, and is
  probably one of the finest which has ever reached England alive.</p>

  <p>The Indian mangouste is described to be the most deadly enemy of
  the cobra di capello, and the battles between them have been
  frequently described. The serpent, when aware of the approach of the
  mangouste, rises on its tail, and with neck dilated, its head
  advanced, and eyes staring, awaits with every look of rage and fear
  the attack of its foe. The mangouste steals nearer and nearer, and
  creeping round, endeavours to get an opportunity of springing on the
  serpent&#39;s back; and whenever it misses its purpose and receives a
  bite, it runs perhaps some distance, to eat the mangouste-grass,
  which is an antidote against the poison: it then returns to the
  attack, in which it is commonly victorious.</p>

  <p>The bite of the cobra di capello is not so immediately fatal as is
  commonly supposed; fowls have been known to live two days after being
  bitten, though they frequently die within half an hour. The snake
  never bites while its hood is closed, and as long as this is not
  erected the animal may be approached, and even handled with impunity;
  even when the hood is spread, while the creature continues silent,
  there is no danger. The fearful hiss is at once the signal of
  aggression and of peril. Though the cobra is so deadly when under
  excitement, it is, nevertheless, astonish ing to see how readily it
  is appeased, even in the highest state of exasperation, and this
  merely by the droning music with which its exhibitors seem to charm
  it.</p><!-- [Illustration: COBRA DI CAPELLO] -->

  </div>

  <p>The natives of India have a superstitious feeling with regard to
  this snake; they conceive that it belongs to another world, and when
  it appears in this, it is only as a visitor. In consequence of this
  notion they always avoid killing it, if possible.</p>

  <p>Perhaps of all the localities of the Oregon territory so vividly
  described in Captain Fremont&#39;s adventurous narrative, the Pyramid
  Lake, visited on the homeward journey from the Dallas to the Missouri
  river, is the most beautiful. The exploring party having reached a
  defile between mountains descending rapidly about 2000 feet, saw,
  filling up all the lower space, a sheet of green water some twenty
  miles broad. &quot;It broke upon our eyes,&quot; says the narrator,
  &quot;like the ocean: the neighbouring peaks rose high above us, and
  we ascended one of them to obtain a better view. The waves were
  curling to the breeze, and their dark green colour showed it to be a
  body of deep water. For a long time we sat enjoying the view, for we
  had become fatigued with mountains, and the free expanse of moving
  waves was very grateful. It was like a gem in the mountains, which,
  from our position, seemed to enclose it almost entirely. At the
  eastern end it communicated with the line of basins we had left a few
  days since; and on the opposite side it swept a ridge of snowy
  mountains, the foot of the great Sierra. We followed a broad Indian
  trail or tract along the shore of the lake to the southward. For a
  short space we had room enough in the bottom, but, after travelling a
  short distance, the water swept the foot of the precipitous
  mountains, the peaks of which are about 3000 feet above the lake. We
  afterwards encamped on the shore, opposite a very remarkable rock in
  the lake, which had attracted our attention for many miles. It rose
  according to our estimation 600 feet above the level of the water,
  and, from the point we viewed it, presented a pretty exact outline of
  the great pyramid of Cheops. Like other rocks along the shore, it
  seemed to be encrusted with calcareous cement. This striking feature
  suggested a name for the lake, and I called it Pyramid Lake. Its
  elevation above the sea is 4890 feet, being nearly 700 feet higher
  than the Great Salt Lake, from which it lies nearly west.&quot; The
  position and elevation of Pyramid Lake make it an object of
  geographical interest. It is the nearest lake to the western river,
  as the Great Salt Lake is to the eastern river, of the great basin
  which lies between the base of the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra
  Nevada, and the extent and character of which it is so desirable to
  know.</p><!-- [Illustration: PYRAMID LAKE, OREGON TERRITORY.] -->

  </div>

  <p>Many parts of the borders of this lake appear to be a favourite
  place of encampment for the Indians, whose number in this country is
  estimated at 140,000. They retain, still unaltered, most of the
  features of the savage character. They procure food almost solely by
  hunting; and to surprise a hostile tribe, to massacre them with every
  exercise of savage cruelty, and to carry off their scalps as
  trophies, is their highest ambition. Their domestic behaviour,
  however, is orderly and peaceable; and they seldom kill or rob a
  white man. Considerable attempts have been made to civilize them, and
  with some success; but the moment that any impulse has been given to
  war and hunting, they have instantly reverted to their original
  habits.</p>

  <p>Goldsmith&#39;s poetry enjoys a calm and steady popularity. It
  inspires us, indeed, with no admiration of daring design or of
  fertile invention; but it presents within its narrow limits a
  distinct and unbroken view of poetical delightfulness. His
  descriptions and sentiments have the pure zest of nature. He is
  refined without false delicacy, and correct without insipidity.
  Perhaps there is an intellectual composure in his manner, which may,
  in some passages, be said to approach to the reserved and prosaic;
  but he unbends from this graver strain of reflection to tenderness,
  and even to playfulness, with an ease and grace almost exclusively
  his own; and connects extensive views of the happiness and interests
  of society with pictures of life that touch the heart by their
  familiarity. He is no disciple of the gaunt and famished school of
  simplicity. He uses the ornaments which must always distinguish true
  poetry from prose; and when he adopts col loquial plainness, it is
  with the utmost skill to avoid a vulgar humility. There is more of
  this sustained simplicity, of this chaste economy and choice of
  words, in Goldsmith than in any other modern poet, or, perhaps, than
  would be attainable or desirable as a standard for every writer of
  rhyme. In extensive narrative poems, such a style would be too
  difficult. There is a noble propriety even in the careless strength
  of great poems, as in the roughness of castle walls; and, generally
  speaking, where there is a long course of story, or observation of
  life to be pursued, such excursite touches as those of Goldsmith
  would be too costly materials for sustaining it. His whole manner has
  a still depth of feeling and reflection, which gives back the image
  of nature unruffled and minutely. His chaste pathos makes him an
  insulating moralist, and throws a charm of Claude-like softness over
  his descriptions of homely objects, that would seem only fit to be
  the subjects of Dutch painting; but his quiet enthusiasm leads the
  affections to humble things without a vulgar association, and he
  inspires us with a fondness to trace the simplest recollections of
  Auburn, till we count the furniture of its ale-house, and listen to
  the varnished clock that clicked behind the door.</p>

  <p>Hagar and Ishmael departed early on the day fixed for their
  removal, Abraham furnishing them with the necessary supply of
  travelling provisions. &quot;And Abraham arose up early in the
  morning, and took bread and a bottle of water, and gave it unto
  Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and she went away.&quot; The
  bottle here mentioned was probably made of the skin of a goat, sewn
  up, leaving an opening in one of the legs to serve as a mouth. Such
  skin bottles are still commonly used in Western Asia for water, and
  are borne slung across the shoulders, just as that of Hagar was
  placed.</p>

  <p>It seems to have been the intention of Hagar to return to her
  native country, Egypt; but, in spite of the directions she received,
  the two travellers lost their way in the southern wilderness, and
  wandered to and fro till the water, which was to have served them on
  the road, was altogether spent. The lad, unused to hardship, was soon
  worn out. Overcome by heat and thirst, he seemed at the point of
  death, when the afflicted mother laid him down under one of the
  stunted shrubs of this dry and desert region, in the hope of his
  getting some relief from the slight damp which the shade afforded.
  The burning fever, however, continued unabated; and the poor mother,
  forgetting her own sorrow, destitute and alone in the midst of a
  wilderness, went to a little distance, unable to witness his
  lingering sufferings, and then &quot;she lifted up her voice and
  wept.&quot; But God had not forgotten her: a voice was heard in the
  solitude, and an Angel of the Lord appeared, uttering words of
  comfort and promises of peace. He directed her to a well of water,
  which, concealed by the brushwood, had not been seen by her. Thus
  encouraged, Hagar drew a refreshing draught, and hastening to her
  son, &quot;raised him by the hand,&quot; and gave him the welcome
  drink, which soon restored him. This well, according to the tradition
  of the Arabs, who pay great honour to the memory of Hagar, is Zemzem,
  near Mecca.</p><!-- [Illustration: HAGAR AND ISHMAEL.] -->

  <p>After this, we have no account of the history of Ishmael, except
  that he established himself in the wilderness of Paran, near Mount
  Sinai, and belonged to one of the tribes by which the desert was
  frequented. He was married, by his mother, to a countrywoman of her
  own, and maintained himself and his family by the produce of his bow.
  Many of the Arabian tribes have been proud to trace their origin to
  this son of the Patriarch Abraham.</p>

  <h2>THE UNIVERSE.</h2>

  <p>To us who dwell on its surface, the earth is by far the most
  extensive orb that our eyes can any where behold; but, to a spectator
  placed on one of the planets, it looks no larger than a spot. To
  beings who dwell at still greater distances, it entirely disappears.
  That which we call alternately the morning and the evening star, as
  in the one part of the orbit she rides foremost in the procession of
  night, in the other ushers in and anticipates the dawn, is a
  planetary world, which, with the five others that so wonderfully vary
  their mystic dance, are in themselves dark bodies, and shine only by
  reflection; have fields, and seas, and skies of their own; are
  furnished with all accommodations for animal subsistence, and are
  supposed to be the abodes of intellectual life. All these, together
  with our earthly habitation, are dependent on the sun, receive their
  light from his rays, and derive their comfort from his benign agency.
  The sun, which seems to us to perform its daily stages through the
  sky, is, in this respect, fixed and immovable; it is the great axle
  about which the globe we inhabit, and other more spacious orbs, wheel
  their stated courses. The sun, though apparently smaller than the
  dial it illuminates, is immensely larger than this whole earth, on
  which so many lofty mountains rise, and such vast oceans roll. A line
  extending from side to side through the centre of that resplendent
  orb, would measure more than 800,000 miles: a girdle formed to go
  round its circumference, would require a length of millions. Are we
  startled at these reports of philosophers? Are we ready to cry out in
  a transport of surprise, &quot;How mighty is the Being who kindled
  such a prodigious fire, and keeps alive from age to age such an
  enormous mass of flame!&quot; Let us attend our philosophic guides,
  and we shall be brought acquainted with speculations more enlarged
  and more inflaming. The sun, with all its attendant planets, is but a
  very little part of the grand machine of the universe; every star,
  though in appearance no bigger than the diamond that glitters upon a
  lady&#39;s ring, is really a vast globe like the sun in size and in
  glory; no less spacious, no less luminous, than the radiant source of
  the day: so that every star is not barely a world, but the centre of
  a magnificent system; has a retinue of worlds irradiated by its
  beams, and revolving round its attractive influence&mdash;all which
  are lost to our sight. That the stars appear like so many diminutive
  points, is owing to their immense and inconceivable distance. Immense
  and inconceivable indeed it is, since a ball shot from a loaded
  cannon, and flying with unabated rapidity, must travel at this
  impetuous rate almost 700,000 years, before it could reach the
  nearest of these twinkling luminaries.</p>

  <p>While beholding this vast expanse I learn my own extreme meanness,
  I would also discover the abject littleness of all terrestrial
  things. What is the earth, with all her ostentatious scenes, compared
  with this astonishingly grand furniture of the skies? What, but a dim
  speck hardly perceptible in the map of the universe? It is observed
  by a very judicious writer, that if the sun himself, which enlightens
  this part of the creation, were extinguished, and all the host of
  planetary worlds which move about him were annihilated, they would
  not be missed by an eye that can take in the whole compass of nature
  any more than a grain of sand upon the sea-shore. The bulk of which
  they consist, and the space which they occupy, are so exceedingly
  little in comparison of the whole, that their loss would leave scarce
  a blank in the immensity of God&#39;s works. If, then, not our globe
  only, but this whole system, be so very dimunitive, what is a kingdom
  or a country? What are a few lordships, or the so-much-admired
  patrimonies of those who are styled wealthy? When I measure them with
  my own little pittance, they swell into proud and bloated dimensions;
  but when I take the universe for my standard, how scanty is their
  size, how contemptible their figure; they shrink into pompous
  nothings!</p>

  <h2>SATIN BOWER-BIRDS.</h2>

  <p>The Satin Bower-Bird was one of the earliest known species in the
  Australian fauna, and probably received the name of <i>Satin
  Grakle</i>, by which it was described in Latham&#39;s &quot;General
  History of Birds,&quot; from the intensely black glossy plumage of
  the adult male. But, although the existence of this bird was noticed
  by most of the writers on the natural history of Australia subsequent
  to Latham, it appears that no suspicion of its singular economy had
  extended beyond the remotest settlers, until Mr. Gould, whose great
  work on the &quot;Birds of Australia&quot; is known to every one,
  unravelled the history of the <i>bowers</i>, which had been
  discovered in many parts of the bush, and which had been attributed
  to almost every possible origin but the right one.</p>

  <p>The bower, as will be seen by the Illustration, is composed of
  twigs woven together in the most compact manner, and ornamented with
  shells and feathers, the disposition of which the birds are
  continually altering. They have no connexion with the nest, and are
  simply playing-places, in which the birds divert themselves during
  the months which precede nidification.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The birds themselves are nearly as large as a jackdaw. The female
  is green in colour, the centre of the breast feathers yellowish; the
  unmoulted plumage of the male is similar: the eyes of both are
  brilliant blue.</p>

  <p>The fountain and pool of Siloam, whose surplus waters flow in a
  little streamlet falling into the lake Kedron, is situate near the
  ancient walls of the city of Jerusalem. Mr. Wild tells us &quot;that
  the fountain of Siloam is a mineral spring of a brackish taste, and
  somewhat of the smell of the Harrowgate water, but in a very slight
  degree.&quot; It is said to possess considerable medicinal
  properties, and is much frequented by pilgrims. &quot;Continuing our
  course,&quot; says he, &quot;around the probable line of the ancient
  walls, along the gentle slope of Zion, we pass by the King&#39;s
  gardens, and arrive at the lower pool of Siloam, placed in another
  indentation in the wall. It is a deep square cistern lined with
  masonry, adorned with columns at the sides, and having a flight of
  steps leading to the bottom, in which there was about two feet of
  water. It communicates by a subterraneous passage with the fountain,
  from which it is distant about 600 yards. The water enters the pool
  by a low arched passage, into which the pilgrims, numbers of whom are
  generally to be found around it, put their heads, as part of the
  ceremony, and wash their clothes in the purifying stream that rises
  from it.&quot; During a rebellion in Jerusalem, in which the Arabs
  inhabiting the Tillage of Siloam were the ringleaders, they gained
  access to the city by means of the conduit of this pool, which again
  rises within the mosque of Omar. This passage is evidently the work
  of art, the water in it is generally about two feet deep, and a man
  may go through it in a stooping position. When the stream leaves the
  pool, it is divided into numbers of little aqueducts, for the purpose
  of irrigating the gardens and pleasure-grounds which lie immediately
  beneath it in the valley, and are the chief source of their
  fertility, for, as they are mostly formed of earth which has been
  carried from other places, they possess no original or natural soil
  capable of supporting vegetation. As there is but little water in the
  pool during the dry season, the Arabs dam up the several streams in
  order to collect a sufficient quantity in small ponds adjoining each
  garden, and this they all do at the same time, or there would be an
  unfair division of the fertilizing fluid. These dams are generally
  made in the evening and drawn off in the morning, or sometimes two or
  three times a day; and thus the reflux of the water that they hold
  gives the appearance of an ebb and flow, which by some travellers has
  caused a report that the pool of Siloam is subject to daily
  tides.</p><!-- [Illustration: THE POOL OF SILOAM.] -->

    <a name="image-0156b"></a> <img src="img/0156b.jpg" alt=
    "The Pool of Siloam.">
  </div>

  <p>There are few towns, and scarcely any metropolitan town, in which
  the natural supply of water is so inadequate as at Jerusalem; hence
  the many and elaborate contrivances to preserve the precious fluid,
  or to bring it to the town by aqueducts.</p>

  <p>Really winter in Canada must be felt to be imagined; and when felt
  can no more be described by words, than colours to a blind man or
  music to a deaf one. Even under bright sun-shine, and in a most
  exhilirating air, the biting effect of the cold upon the portion of
  our face that is exposed to it resembles the application of a strong
  acid; and the healthy grin which the countenance assumes,
  requires&mdash;as I often observed on those who for many minutes had
  been in a warm room waiting to see me&mdash;a considerable time to
  relax.</p>

  <p>In a calm, almost any degree of cold is bearable, but the
  application of successive doses of it to the face by wind, becomes,
  occasionally, almost unbearable; indeed, I remember seeing the left
  cheek of nearly twenty of our soldiers simultaneously frost-bitten in
  marching about a hundred yards across a bleak open space, completely
  exposed to a strong and bitterly cold north-west wind that was
  blowing upon us all.</p>

  <p>The remedy for this intense cold, to which many Canadians and
  others have occasionally recourse, is&mdash;at least to my feelings
  it always appeared&mdash;infinitely worse than the disease. On
  entering, for instance, the small parlour of a little inn, a number
  of strong, able-bodied fellows are discovered holding their hands a
  few inches before their faces, and sitting in silence immediately in
  front of a stove of such excruciating power, that it really feels as
  if it would roast the very eyes in their sockets; and yet, as one
  endures this agony, the back part is as cold as if it belonged to
  what is called at home &quot;Old Father Christmas.&quot;</p>

  <p>As a further instance of the climate, I may add, that several
  times, while my mind was very warmly occupied in writing my
  despatches, I found my pen full of a lump of stuff that appeared to
  be honey, but which proved to be frozen ink; again, after washing in
  the morning, when I took up some money that had lain all night on my
  table, I at first fancied it had become sticky, until I discovered
  that the sensation was caused by its freezing to my fingers, which,
  in consequence of my ablutions, were not perfectly dry.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Notwithstanding, however, this intensity of cold, the powerful
  circulation of the blood of large quadrupeds keeps the red fluid,
  like the movement of the waters in the great lakes, from freezing;
  but the human frame not being gifted with this power, many people
  lose their limbs, and occasionally their lives, from cold. I one day
  inquired of a fine, ruddy, honest-looking man, who called upon me,
  and whose toes and instep of each foot had been truncated, how the
  accident happened? He told me that the first winter he came from
  England he lost his way in the forest, and that after walking for
  some hours, feeling pain in his feet, he took off his boots, and from
  the flesh immediately swelling, he was unable to put them on again.
  His stockings, which were very old ones, soon wore into holes; and as
  rising on his insteps he was hurriedly proceeding he knew not where,
  he saw with alarm, but without feeling the slightest pain, first one
  toe and then another break off, as if they had been pieces of brittle
  stick, and in this mutilated state he continued to advance till he
  reached a path which led him to an inhabited log house, where he
  remained suffering great pain till his cure was effected.</p>

  <p>Although the sun, from the latitude, has considerable power, it
  appears only to illuminate the sparkling snow, which, like the sugar
  on a bridal cake, conceals the whole surface. The instant, however,
  the fire of heaven sinks below the horizon, the cold descends from
  the upper regions of the atmosphere with a feeling as if it were
  poured down upon the head and shoulders from a jug.</p>

  <h2>BALLOONS.</h2>

  <p>The idea of constructing a machine which should enable us to rise
  into and sail through the air, seems often to have occupied the
  attention of mankind, even from remote times, but it was never
  realised until within the last sixty or seventy years. The first
  public ascent of a fire-balloon in France, in 1783, led to an
  experiment on the part of Joseph Mongolfier. He constructed a balloon
  of linen, lined with paper, which, when inflated by means of burning
  chopped straw and coal, was found to be capable of raising 500 pounds
  weight. It was inflated in front of the Palace at Versailles, in the
  presence of the Royal family, and a basket, containing a sheep, a
  duck, and a cock, was attached to it. It was then liberated, and
  ascended to the height of 1500 feet. It fell about two miles from
  Versailles; the animals were uninjured, and the sheep was found
  quietly feeding near the place of its descent.</p>

  <p>Monsieur Mongolfier then constructed one of superior strength, and
  a M. de Rozier ventured to take his seat in the car and ascend three
  hundred feet, the height allowed by the ropes, which were not cut.
  This same person afterwards undertook an aerial voyage, descending in
  safety about five miles from Paris, where the balloon ascended. But
  this enterprising voyager in the air afterwards attempted to travel
  in a balloon with sails. This was formed by a singular combination of
  balloons&mdash;one inflated with hydrogen gas, and the other a
  fire-balloon. The latter, however, catching fire, the whole apparatus
  fell from the height of about three-quarters of a mile, with the
  mangled bodies of the voyagers attached to the complicated
  machinery.</p><!-- [Illustration: GREEN'S BALLOON, ASCENDING FROM VAUXHALL GARDENS.] -->

  <p>A Frenchman named Tester, in 1786, also made an excursion in a bal
  loon with sails; these sails or wings aided in carrying his balloon
  so high, that when he had reached an elevation of 3000 feet, fearing
  his balloon might burst, he descended into a corn-field in the plain
  of Montmorency. An immense crowd ran eagerly to the spot; and the
  owner of the field, angry at the injury his crop had sustained,
  demanded instant indemnification. Tester offered no resistance, but
  persuaded the peasants that, having lost his wings, he could not
  possibly escape. The ropes were seized by a number of persons, who
  attempted to drag the balloon towards the village; but as, during the
  procession, it had acquired considerable buoyancy, Tester suddenly
  cut the cords, and, rising in the air, left the disappointed peasants
  overwhelmed in astonishment. After being out in a terrible
  thunder-storm, he descended uninjured, about twelve hours from the
  time of his first ascent.</p>

  <p>Among the worthies of this country who, after a successful and
  honourable employment of their talent in life, have generously
  consulted the advantage of generations to come after them, few names
  appear more conspicuous than that of Sir Thomas Gresham, the founder
  of Gresham College, and of the Royal Exchange, London. He was born in
  that city about the year 1518, the second son of Sir Richard Gresham,
  who served the office of sheriff in 1531, and that of Lord Mayor in
  1537. He received a liberal education at the University, and is
  mentioned in high terms as having distinguished himself at Cambridge,
  being styled &quot;that noble and most learned merchant.&quot; His
  father at this time held the responsible position of King&#39;s
  merchant, and had the management of the Royal monies at Antwerp, then
  the most important seat of commerce in Europe; and when his son Sir
  Thomas succeeded him in this responsible appointment, he not only
  established his fame as a merchant, but secured universal respect and
  esteem. After the accession of Queen Elizabeth, his good qualities
  attracted the peculiar notice of her Majesty, who was pleased to
  bestow on him the honour of knighthood; and at this time he built the
  noble house in Bishopsgate-street, which after his death was
  converted to the purposes of a College of his own foundation.</p>

  <p>In the year 1564, Sir Thomas made an offer to the Corporation of
  London, that, if the City would give him a piece of ground, he would
  erect an Exchange at his own expense; and thus relieve the merchants
  from their present uncomfortable mode of transacting business in the
  open air. The liberal offer being accepted, the building, which was
  afterwards destroyed in the Great Fire of London, was speedily
  constructed, at a very great expense, and ornamented with a number of
  statues. Nor did Gresham&#39;s persevering benevolence stop here:
  though he had so much to engross his time and attention, he still
  found leisure to consider the claims of the destitute and aged, and
  in his endowment of eight alms-houses with a comfortable allowance
  for as many decayed citizens of London, displayed that excellent
  grace of charity which was his truest ornament.</p>

  <p>In person Sir Thomas was above the middle height, and handsome
  when a young man, but he was rendered lame by a fall from his horse
  during one of his journeys in Flanders. Sir Thomas Gresham&#39;s
  exemplary life terminated suddenly on the 21st of November, 1579,
  after he had just paid a visit to the noble building which he had so
  generously founded.</p><!-- [Illustration: Sir Thomas Gresham.] -->

  <h2>ON THE ATTAINMENT OF KNOWLEDGE.</h2>

  <p>Let the enlargement of your knowledge be one constant view and
  design in life; since there is no time or place, no transactions,
  occurrences, or engagements in life, which exclude us from this
  method of improving the mind. When we are alone, even in darkness and
  silence, we may converse with our own hearts, observe the working of
  our own spirits, and reflect upon the inward motions of our own
  passions in some of the latest occurrences in life; we may acquaint
  ourselves with the powers and properties, the tendencies and
  inclinations both of body and spirit, and gain a more intimate
  knowledge of ourselves. When we are in company, we may discover
  something more of human nature, of human passions and follies, and of
  human affairs, vices and virtues, by conversing with mankind, and
  observing their conduct. Nor is there any thing more valuable than
  the knowledge of ourselves and the knowledge of men, except it be the
  knowledge of God who made us, and our relation to Him as our
  Governor.</p>

  <p>When we are in the house or the city, wheresoever we turn our
  eyes, we see the works of men; when we are abroad in the country, we
  behold more of the works of God. The skies and the ground above and
  beneath us, and the animal and vegetable world round about us, may
  entertain our observation with ten thousand varieties.</p>

  <p>Fetch down some knowledge from the clouds, the stars, the sun, the
  moon, and the revolutions of all the planets. Dig and draw up some
  valuable meditations from the depths of the earth, and search them
  through the vast oceans of water. Extract some intellectual
  improvement from the minerals and metals; from the wonders of nature
  among the vegetables and herbs, trees and flowers. Learn some lessons
  from the birds and the beasts, and the meanest insect. Read the
  wisdom of God, and his admirable contrivance in them all: read his
  almighty power, his rich and various goodness, in all the works of
  his hands.</p>

  <p>From the day and the night, the hours and the flying minutes,
  learn a wise improvement of time, and be watchful to seize every
  opportunity to increase in knowledge.</p>

  <p>From the vices and follies of others, observe what is hateful in
  them; consider how such a practice looks in another person, and
  remember that it looks as ill or worse in yourself. From the virtue
  of others, learn something worthy of your imitation.</p>

  <p>From the deformity, the distress, or calamity of others, derive
  lessons of thankfulness to God, and hymns of grateful praise to your
  Creator, Governor, and Benefactor, who has formed you in a better
  mould, and guarded you from those evils. Learn also the sacred lesson
  of contentment in your own estate, and compassion to your neighbour
  under his miseries.</p>

  <p>From your natural powers, sensations, judgment, memory, hands,
  feet, &amp;c., make this inference, that they were not given you for
  nothing, but for some useful employment to the honour of your Maker,
  and for the good of your fellow-creatures, as well as for your own
  best interest and final happiness.</p>

  <h2>THIBETAN SHEEP.</h2>

  <p>The enterprising traveller, Moorcroft, during his journey across
  the vast chain of the Himalaya Mountains, in India, undertaken with
  the hope of finding a passage across those mountains into Tartary,
  noticed, in the district of Ladak, the peculiar race of sheep of
  which we give an Engraving. Subsequent observations having confirmed
  his opinion as to the quality of their flesh and wool, the Honourable
  East India Company imported a flock, which were sent for a short time
  to the Gardens of the Zoological Society, Regent&#39;s Park. They
  were then distributed among those landed proprietors whose
  possessions are best adapted, by soil and climate, for naturalising
  in the British Islands this beautiful variety of the mountain sheep.
  The wool, the flesh, and the milk of the sheep appear to have been
  very early appreciated as valuable products of the animal: with us,
  indeed, the milk of the flock has given place to that of the herd;
  but the two former still retain their importance. Soon after the
  subjugation of Britain by the Romans, a woollen manufactory was
  established at Winchester, situated in the midst of a district then,
  as now, peculiarly suited to the short-woolled breed of sheep. So
  successful was this manufacture, that British cloths were soon
  preferred at Rome to those of any other part of the Empire, and were
  worn by the most opulent on festive and ceremonial occasions. From
  that time forward, the production of wool in this island, and the
  various manufactures connected with it, have gone on increasing in
  importance, until it has become one of the chief branches of our
  commerce.</p><!-- [Illustration: THIBETAN SHEEP.] -->

  <p>On being told the number and size of the sails which a vessel can
  carry (that is to say, can sail with, without danger of being upset),
  the uninitiated seldom fail to express much surprise. This is not so
  striking in a three-decker, as in smaller vessels, because the hull
  of the former stands very high out of the water, for the sake of its
  triple rank of guns, and therefore bears a greater proportion to its
  canvas than that of a frigate or a smaller vessel. The apparent
  inequality is most obvious in the smallest vessels, as cutters: and
  of those kept for pleasure, and therefore built for the purpose of
  sailing as fast as possible, without reference to freight or load,
  there are many the hull of which might be entirely wrapt up in the
  mainsail. It is of course very rarely, if ever, that a vessel carries
  at one time all the sail she is capable of; the different sails being
  usually employed according to the circumstances of direction of wind
  and course. The sails of a ship, when complete, are as
  follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>The lowermost sail of the mast, called thence the <i>mainsail</i>,
  or <i>foresail</i>; the <i>topsail</i>, carried by the
  <i>topsail-yard</i>; the <i>top-gallant-sail</i>; and above this
  there is also set a <i>royal</i> sail, and again above this, but only
  on emergencies, a sail significantly called a <i>sky-sail</i>.
  Besides all this, the three lowermost of these are capable of having
  their surface to be exposed to the wind increased by means of
  <i>studding</i> sails, which are narrow sails set on each side beyond
  the regular one, by means of small <i>booms</i> or yards, which can
  be slid out so as to extend the lower yards and topsail-yards: the
  upper parts of these additional sails hang from small yards suspended
  from the principal ones, and the boom of the lower studding-sails is
  hooked on to the chains. Thus each of the two principal masts, the
  fore and main, are capable of bearing no less than thirteen distinct
  sails. If a ship could be imagined as cut through by a plane, at
  right angles to the keel, close to the mainmast, the <i>area</i>, or
  surface, of all the sails on this would be five or six times as great
  as that of the section or profile of the hull!</p>

  <p>The starboard studding-sails are on the fore-mast, and on both
  sides of the main-top-gallant and main-royal; but, in going nearly
  before a wind, there is no advantage derived from the stay-sails,
  which, accordingly, are not set. The flying-jib is to be set to
  assist in steadying the motion.</p>

  <p>The mizen-mast, instead of a lower square-sail like the two
  others, has a sail like that of a cutter, lying in the plane of the
  keel, its bottom stretched on a boom, which extends far over the
  taffarel, and the upper edge carried by a <i>gaff</i> or yard sloping
  upwards, supported by ropes from the top of the mizen-mast.</p>

  <p>All these sails, the sky-sails excepted, have four sides, as have
  also the sprit-sails on the bowsprit, jib-boom, &amp;c.; and all,
  except the sail last mentioned on the mizen, usually lie across the
  ship, or in planes forming considerable angles with the axis or
  central line of the ship. There are a number of sails which lie in
  the same plane with the keel, being attached to the various
  <i>stays</i> of the masts; these are triangular sails, and those are
  called <i>stay-sails</i> which are between the masts: those before
  the fore-mast, and connected with the bowsprit, are the <i>fore
  stay-sail</i>, the <i>fore-topmast-stay-sail</i>, the <i>jib</i>,
  sometimes a <i>flying jib</i>, and another called a <i>middle
  jib</i>, and there are two or three others used occasionally. Thus it
  appears that there are no less than fifty-three different sails,
  which are used at times, though, we believe, seldom more than twenty
  are <i>set</i> at one time, for it is obviously useless to extend or
  set a sail, if the wind is prevented from filling it by another which
  intercepts the current of air.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The higher the wind, the fewer the sails which a ship can carry;
  but as a certain number, or rather quantity, of canvas is necessary
  in different parts of the ship to allow of the vessel being steered,
  the principal sails, that is, the <i>courses</i> or lower sails, and
  the top-sails, admit of being reduced in extent by what is termed
  <i>reefing</i>: this is done by tying up the upper part of the sail
  to the yard by means of rows of strings called <i>reef-points</i>
  passing through the canvas; this reduces the depth of the sail, while
  its width is unaltered on the yard, which is therefore obliged to be
  lowered on the mast accordingly.</p>

  <p>Ships are principally distinguished as those called merchantmen,
  which belong to individuals or companies, and are engaged in
  commerce; and men-of-war, or the national ships, built for the
  purposes of war. The latter receive their designation from the number
  of their decks, or of the guns which they carry. The largest are
  termed ships of the line, from their forming the line of battle when
  acting together in fleets; and are divided into first-rates,
  second-rates, third-rates, &amp;c. First-rates include all those
  carrying 100 guns and upwards, with a company of 850 men and upwards;
  second-rates mount 90 to 100 guns, and so on, down to the
  sixth-rates; but some ships of less than 44 guns are termed
  frigates.</p>

  <p>There are three principal masts in a complete ship: the first is
  the main-mast, which stands in the centre of the ship; at a
  considerable distance forward is the fore-mast; and at a less
  distance behind, the mizen-mast. These masts, passing through the
  decks, are fixed firmly in the keel. There are added to them other
  masts, which can be taken down or raised&mdash;hoisted, as it is
  termed at sea&mdash;at pleasure: these are called top-masts, and,
  according to the mast to which each is attached&mdash;main, fore, or
  mizen-topmast. When the topmast is carried still higher by the
  addition of a third, it receives the name of top-gallant-mast. The
  yards are long poles of wood slung across the masts, or attached to
  them by one end, and having fixed to them the upper edge of the
  principal sails. They are named upon the same plan as the masts; for
  example, the main-yard, the fore-top-sail-yard, and so on. The
  bowsprit is a strong conical piece of timber, projecting from the
  stem of a ship, and serving to support the fore-mast, and as a yard
  or boom on which certain sails are moveable.</p>

  <p>According as the wind blows from different points, in regard to
  the course the ship is sailing, it is necessary that the direction of
  the yards should be changed, so as to form different angles with the
  central line or with the keel; this is effected by ropes brought from
  the ends of the yards to the mast behind that to which these belong,
  and then, passing through blocks, they come down to the deck: by
  pulling one of these, the other being slackened, the yard is brought
  round to the proper degree of inclination; this is termed bracing the
  yards, the ropes being termed braces.</p>

  <h2>THE CHOICE OF HERCULES.</h2>

  <p>When Hercules was in that part of his youth in which it was
  natural for him to consider what course of life he ought to pursue,
  he one day retired into a desert, where the silence and solitude of
  the place very much favoured his meditations. As he was musing on his
  present condition, and very much perplexed in himself on the state of
  life he should choose, he saw two women, of a larger stature than
  ordinary, approaching towards him. One of them had a very noble air,
  and graceful deportment; her beauty was natural and easy, her person
  clean and unspotted, her eyes cast towards the ground with an
  agreeable reserve, her motion and behaviour full of modesty, and her
  raiment as white as snow. The other had a great deal of health and
  floridness in her countenance, which she had helped with an
  artificial white and red; and she endeavoured to appear more graceful
  than ordinary in her mien, by a mixture of affectation in all her
  gestures. She had a wonderful confidence and assurance in her looks,
  and all the variety of colours in her dress, that she thought were
  the most proper to shew her complexion to advantage. She cast her
  eyes upon herself, then turned them on those that were present, to
  see how they liked her, and often looked on the figure she made in
  her own shadow. Upon her nearer approach to Hercules, she stepped
  before the other lady, who came forward with a regular, composed
  carriage, and running up to him, accosted him after the following
  manner:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&quot;My dear Hercules!&quot; says she, &quot;I find you are very
  much divided in your thoughts upon the way of life that you ought to
  choose; be my friend, and follow me; I will lead you into the
  possession of pleasure, and out of the reach of pain, and remove you
  from all the noise and disquie tude of business. The affairs of
  either war or peace shall have no power to disturb you. Your whole
  employment shall be to make your life easy, and to entertain every
  sense with its proper gratifications. Sumptuous tables, beds of
  roses, clouds of perfume, concerts of music, crowds of beauties, are
  all in readiness to receive you. Come along with me into this region
  of delights, this world of pleasure, and bid farewell for ever to
  care, to pain, to business.&quot; Hercules, hearing the lady talk
  after this manner, desired to know her name, to which she
  answered&mdash;&quot;My friends, and those who are well acquainted
  with me, call me Happiness; but my enemies, and those who would
  injure my reputation, have given me the name of Pleasure.&quot;</p>

  <p>By this time the other lady was come up, who addressed herself to
  the young hero in a very different
  manner:&mdash;&quot;Hercules,&quot; says she, &quot;I offer myself to
  you because I know you are descended from the gods, and give proofs
  of that descent by your love of virtue and application to the studies
  proper for your age. This makes me hope you will gain, both for
  yourself and me, an immortal reputation. But before I invite you into
  my society and friendship, I will be open and sincere with you, and
  must lay this down as an established truth, that there is nothing
  truly valuable which can be purchased without pains and labour. The
  gods have set a price upon every real and noble pleasure. If you
  would gain the favour of the Deity, you must be at the pains of
  worshipping Him; if the friendship of good men, you must study to
  oblige them; if you would be honoured by your country, you must take
  care to serve it; in short, if you would be eminent in war or peace,
  you must become master of all the qualifications that can make you
  so. These are the only terms and conditions upon which I can propose
  happiness.&quot;</p>

  <p>The Goddess of Pleasure here broke in upon her
  discourse:&mdash;&quot;You see,&quot; said she, &quot;Hercules, by
  her own confession, the way to her pleasures is long and difficult;
  whereas that which I propose is short and easy.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Alas!&quot; said the other lady, whose visage glowed with
  passion, made up of scorn and pity, &quot;what are the pleasures you
  propose? To eat before you are hungry; drink before you are athirst;
  sleep before you are tired; to gratify appetites before they are
  raised, and raise such appetites as Nature never planted. You never
  heard the most delicious music, which is the praise of
  one&#39;s-self; nor saw the most beautiful object, which is the work
  of one&#39;s own hands. Your votaries pass away their youth in a
  dream of mistaken pleasures, while they are hoarding up anguish,
  torment, and remorse for old age. As for me, I am the friend of gods
  and of good men; an agreeable companion to the artizan; an household
  guardian to the fathers of families; a patron and protector of
  servants; an associate in all true and generous friendships. The
  banquets of my votaries are never costly, but always delicious; for
  none eat or drink of them who are not invited by hunger or thirst.
  Their slumbers are sound, and their wakings cheerful. My young men
  have the pleasure of hearing themselves praised by those who are in
  years; and those who are in years, of being honoured by those who are
  young. In a word, my followers are favoured by the gods, beloved by
  their acquaintance, esteemed by their country, and after the close of
  their labours honoured by posterity.&quot;</p>

  <p>We know, by the life of this memorable hero, to which of these two
  ladies he gave up his heart; and I believe every one who reads this
  will do him the justice to approve his choice.</p>

  <p>The remains of Strata Florida Abbey, in South Wales, are most
  interesting in many points of view, more especially as the relics of
  a stately seminary for learning, founded as early as the year 1164.
  The community of the Abbey were Cistercian monks, who soon attained
  great celebrity, and acquired extensive possessions. A large library
  was founded by them, which included the national records from the
  earliest periods, the works of the bards and the genealogies of the
  Princes and great families in Wales. The monks also compiled a
  valuable history of the Principality, down to the death of Llewellyn
  the Great. When Edward I. invaded Wales, he burned the Abbey, but it
  was rebuilt A.D. 1294.</p>

  <p>Extensive woods once flourished in the vicinity of Strata Florida,
  and its burial-place covered no less than 120 acres. A long list of
  eminent persons from all parts of Wales were here buried, and amongst
  them David ap Gwillim, the famous bard. The churchyard is now reduced
  to small dimensions; but leaden coffins, doubtless belonging to once
  celebrated personages, are still found, both there and at a distance
  from the cemetery. A few aged box and yew-trees now only remain to
  tell of the luxuriant verdure which once grew around the Abbey; and
  of the venerable pile itself little is left, except an arch, and the
  fragment of a fine old wall, about forty feet high. A small church
  now stands within the enclosure, more than commonly interesting from
  having been built with the materials of the once celebrated Abbey of
  Strata Florida.</p>

  <h2>KAFFIR CHIEFS.</h2><!-- [Illustration] -->

  <div class="illustration">
    <a name="image-0173"></a> <img src="img/0173.jpg" alt=
    "Kaffir Chiefs.">
  </div>

  <p>In the warm summer months a thin kind of petticoat constitutes the
  sole bodily attire of the Kaffir Chiefs; but in winter a cloak is
  used, made of the skins of wild beasts, admirably curried. The head,
  even in the hottest weather, is never protected by any covering, a
  fillet, into which a feather of the ostrich is stuck, being generally
  worn; and they seldom wear shoes, except on undertaking a long
  journey, when they condescend to use a rude substitute for them. The
  bodies of both sexes are tattooed; and the young men, like the fops
  of more civilized nations, paint their skins and curl their hair.
  Their arms are the javelin, a large shield of buffalo-hide, and a
  short club.</p>

  <p>The women exhibit taste in the arrangement of their dress,
  particularly for that of the head, which consists of a turban made of
  skin, and profusely ornamented with beads, of which adornment both
  men and women are very fond. A mantle of skin, variously bedecked
  with these and other showy trinkets, is worn; and the only
  distinction between the dress of the chieftains&#39; wives and those
  of a lower rank consists in a greater profusion of ornaments
  possessed by the former, but of which all are alike vain. There is no
  change of dress, the whole wardrobe of the female being that which
  she carries about with her and sleeps in, for bed-clothes they have
  none.</p>

  <p>The grain which they chiefly cultivate is a kind of millet: a
  small quantity of Indian corn and some pumpkins are likewise grown;
  but a species of sugar-cane is produced in great abundance, and of
  this they are extremely fond. Their diet, however, is chiefly milk in
  a sour curdled state. They dislike swine&#39;s flesh, keep no
  poultry, are averse to fish, but indulge in eating the flesh of their
  cattle, which they do in a very disgusting way. Although naturally
  brave and warlike, they prefer an indolent pastoral life, hunting
  being an occasional pastime.</p>

  <p>Much light was thrown on the condition and future prospects of
  this people in 1835, by some papers relative to the Cape of Good
  Hope, which were laid before the English Government. From these it
  appeared that a system of oppression and unjustifiable appropriation
  on the part of the whites, have from time to time roused the savage
  energies of the Kaffirs, and impelled them to make severe reprisals
  upon their European spoilers. The longing of the Cape colonists for
  the well-watered valleys of the Kaffirs, and of the latter for the
  colonial cattle, which are much superior to their own, still are, as
  they have always been, the sources of irritation. Constant skirmishes
  took place, until, at length, in 1834, the savages poured into the
  colony in vast numbers, wasted the farms, drove off the cattle, and
  murdered not a few of the inhabitants. An army of 4000 men was
  marched against the invaders, who were driven far beyond the
  boundary-line which formerly separated Kaffirland from Cape Colony,
  and not only forced to confine themselves within the new limits
  prescribed, but to pay a heavy fine. Treaties have been entered into,
  and tracts of country assigned to the Kaffir chiefs of several
  families, who acknowledge themselves to be subjects of Great Britain,
  and who are to pay a fat ox annually as a quit-rent for the lands
  which they occupy.</p>

  <p>Macomo, one of the Kaffir Chiefs, is a man of most remarkable
  character and talent, and succeeded his father, Gaika, who had been
  possessed of much greater power and wider territories than the son,
  but had found himself compelled to yield up a large portion of his
  lands to the colonists. Macomo received no education; all the culture
  which his mind ever obtained being derived from occasional
  intercourse with missionaries, after he had grown to manhood. From
  1819, the period of Gaika&#39;s concessions, up to the year 1829, he
  with his tribe dwelt upon the Kat river, following their pastoral
  life in peace, and cultivating their corn-fields. Suddenly they were
  ejected from their lands by the Kat river, on the plea that Gaika had
  ceded these lands to the colony. Macomo retired, almost without a
  murmur, to a district farther inland, leaving the very grain growing
  upon his fields. He took up a new position on the banks of the river
  Chunice, and here he and his tribe dwelt until 1833, when they were
  again driven out to seek a new home, almost without pretence. On this
  occasion Macomo did make a remonstrance, in a document addressed to
  an influential person of the colony. &quot;In the whole of this
  savage Kaffir&#39;s letter, there is,&quot; says Dr. Philip, &quot;a
  beautiful simplicity, a touching pathos, a confiding magnanimity, a
  dignified remonstrance, which shows its author to be no common man.
  It was dictated to an interpreter.&quot;</p><!-- [Illustration] -->

  <p>&quot;As I and my people,&quot; writes Macomo, &quot;have been
  driven back over the Chunice, without being informed why, I should be
  glad to know from the Government what evil we have done. I was only
  told that we <i>must</i> retire over the Chunice, but for what reason
  I was not informed. It was agreed that I and my people should live
  west of the Chunice, as well as east of it. When shall I and my
  people be able to get rest?&quot;</p>

  </div>

  <p>Of the difficulties which occasionally baffle the man of science,
  in his endeavours to contend with the hidden secrets of the crust of
  the earth which we inhabit, the Kilsby Tunnel of the London and
  North-western Railway presents a striking example. The proposed
  tunnel was to be driven about 160 feet below the surface. It was to
  be, as indeed it is, 2399 yards in length, with two shafts of the
  extraordinary size of sixty feet in diameter, not only to give air
  and ventilation, but to admit light enough to enable the
  engine-driver, in passing through it with a train, to see the rails
  from end to end. In order correctly to ascertain, and honestly to
  make known to the contractors the nature of the ground through which
  this great work was to pass, the engineer-in-chief sank the usual
  number of what are called &quot;trial shafts;&quot; and, from the
  result, the usual advertisements for tenders were issued, and the
  shafts, &amp;c. having been minutely examined by the competing
  contractors, the work was let to one of them for the sum of
  &pound;99,000. In order to drive the tunnel, it was deemed necessary
  to construct eighteen working shafts, by which, like the heavings of
  a mole, the contents of the subterranean gallery were to be brought
  to the surface. This interesting work was in busy progress, when, all
  of a sudden, it was ascertained, that, at about 200 yards from the
  south end of the tunnel, there existed, overlaid by a bed of clay,
  forty feet thick, a hidden quicksand, which extended 400 yards into
  the proposed tunnel, and which the trial shafts on each side of it
  had almost miraculously just passed without touching. Overwhelmed at
  the discovery, the contractor instantly took to his bed; and though
  he was justly relieved by the company from his engagement, the
  reprieve came too late, for he actually died.</p>

  <p>The general opinion of the several eminent engineers who were
  consulted was against proceeding; but Mr. R. Stephenson offered to
  undertake the responsibility of the work. His first operation was to
  lower the water with which he had to contend, and it was soon
  ascertained that the quicksand in question covered several square
  miles. The tunnel, thirty feet high by thirty feet broad, was formed
  of bricks, laid in cement, and the bricklayers were progressing in
  lengths averaging twelve feet, when those who were nearest the
  quicksand, on driving into the roof, were suddenly almost overwhelmed
  by a deluge of water, which burst in upon them. As it was evident
  that no time was to be lost, a gang of workmen, protected by the
  extreme power of the engines, were, with their materials, placed on a
  raft; and while, with the utmost celerity, they were completing the
  walls of that short length, the water, in spite of every effort to
  keep it down, rose with such rapidity, that, at the conclusion of the
  work, the men were so near being jammed against the roof, that the
  assistant-engineer jumped overboard, and then swimming, with a rope
  in his mouth, he towed the raft to the nearest working shaft, through
  which he and his men were safely lifted to daylight, or, as it is
  termed by miners, &quot;to grass.&quot;</p>

    "Deep Cutting Near the Tunnel.">
  </div>

  <p>The water now rose in the shaft, and, as it is called,
  &quot;drowned the works&quot; but, by the main strength of 1250 men,
  200 horses, and thirteen steam-engines, not only was the work
  gradually completed, but, during day and night for eight months, the
  almost incredible quantity of 1800 gallons of water per minute was
  raised, and conducted away. The time occupied from the laying of the
  first brick to the completion was thirty months.</p>

  <h2>SUN FISH.</h2>

  <p>While lying in Little Killery Bay, on the coast of Connemara, in
  her Majesty&#39;s surveying ketch <i>Sylvia</i>, we were attracted by
  a large fin above the surface, moving with an oscillatory motion,
  somewhat resembling the action of a man sculling at the stern of a
  boat; and knowing it to be an unusual visitor, we immediately got up
  the harpoon and went in chase. In the meantime, a country boat came
  up with the poor animal, and its crew inflicted upon it sundry blows
  with whatever they could lay their hands on&mdash;oars, grappling,
  stones, &amp;c.&mdash;but were unsuccessful in taking it; and it
  disappeared for some few minutes, when it again exhibited its fin on
  the other side of the Bay. The dull and stupid animal permitted us to
  place our boat immediately over it, and made no effort to escape. The
  harpoon never having been sharpened, glanced off without effect; but
  another sailor succeeded in securing it by the tail with a boat-hook,
  and passing the bight of a rope behind its fins, we hauled it on
  shore, under Salrock House, the residence of General Thompson, who,
  with his family, came down to inspect this strange-looking inhabitant
  of the sea. We were well soused by the splashing of its fins, ere a
  dozen hands succeeded in transporting this heavy creature from its
  native abode to the shore, where it passively died, giving only an
  occasional movement with its fins, or uttering a kind of grunt.</p>

  </div>

  <p>This animal, I believe, is a specimen of the Sun-fish
  (<i>Orthagoriscus</i>). It has no bony skeleton; nor did we, in our
  rather hasty dissection, discover any osseous structure whatever,
  except (as we were informed by one who afterwards inspected it) that
  there was one which stretched between the large fins. Its jaws also
  had bony terminations, unbroken into teeth, and parrot-like, which,
  when not in use, are hidden by the envelopement of the gums. The form
  of the animal is preserved by an entire cartilaginous case, of about
  three inches in thickness, covered by a kind of shagreen skin, so
  amalgamated with the cartilage as not to be separated from it. This
  case is easily penetrable with a knife, and is of pearly whiteness,
  more resembling cocoa-nut in appearance and texture than anything
  else I can compare it with. The interior cavity, containing the vital
  parts, terminates a little behind the large fins, where the cartilage
  was solid, to its tapered extremity, which is without a caudal fin.
  Within, and around the back part, lay the flesh, of a coarse fibrous
  texture, slightly salmon-coloured. The liver was such as to fill a
  common pail, and there was a large quantity of red blood. The
  nostril, top of the eye, and top of the gill-orifice are in line, as
  represented in the Engraving. The dimensions are as under:&mdash;</p>

  <p>Eye round, and like that of an ox, 2-1/4 inches diameter.
  Gill-orifice, 4 inches by 2-1/4 inches. Dorsal and anal fins equal, 2
  ft. 2 in. long, by 1 ft. 3 in. wide. Pectoral fins, 10 in. high by 8
  broad. Length of fish, 6 ft. Depth, from the extremities of the large
  fins, 7 ft. 4 in. Extreme breadth at the swelling under the eye, only
  20 in. Weight, 6 cwt. 42 lb.</p>

  <p>Cannon took their name from the French word <i>Canne</i>, a reed.
  Before their invention, machines were used for throwing enormous
  stones. These were imitated from the Arabs, and called
  <i>ingenia</i>, whence engineer. The first cannon were made of wood,
  wrapped up in numerous folds of linen, and well secured by iron
  hoops. The true epoch of the use of metallic cannon cannot be
  ascertained; it is certain, however, that they were in use about the
  middle of the 14th century. The Engraving beneath represents a
  field-battery gun taking up its position in a canter. The piece of
  ordnance is attached, or &quot;limbered up&quot; to an ammunition
  carriage, capable of carrying two gunners, or privates, whilst the
  drivers are also drilled so as to be able to serve at the gun in
  action, in case of casualties.</p>

  <p>Having reached its destination, and been detached or
  &quot;unlimbered&quot; from the front carriage, we next see the
  action of loading; the ramrod having at its other extremity a
  sheep-skin mop, larger than the bore of the piece, and called &quot;a
  sponge.&quot; This instrument, before loading, is invariably used,
  whilst the touch-hole or &quot;vent&quot; is covered by the thumb of
  the gunner especially numbered off for this important duty; and the
  air being thus excluded, the fire, which often remains within the
  bore, attached to either portions of cartridge-case or wadding, is
  extinguished. Serious accidents have been known to occur from a
  neglect of this important preliminary to loading; as a melancholy
  instance, a poor fellow may be seen about the Woolwich barracks,
  <i>both</i> of whose arms were blown off above the elbow joint,
  whilst ramming home a cartridge before the sponge had been properly
  applied.</p>

  </div>

  <p>If it is deemed essential to keep up a fire upon the enemy during
  a temporary retreat, or in order to avoid an overwhelming body of
  cavalry directed against guns unsupported by infantry, in that case
  the limber remains as close as possible to the field-piece, as shown
  in the Engraving above.</p>

  <p>Skilful provisions are made against the various contingencies
  likely to occur in action. A wheel may he shattered by the
  enemy&#39;s shot, and the gun thereby disabled for the moment: this
  accident is met by supporting the piece upon a handspike, firmly
  grasped by one or two men on each side, according to the weight of
  the gun, whilst a spare wheel, usually suspended at the back of
  &quot;the tumbril,&quot; or ammunition waggon, is obtained, and in a
  few moments made to remedy the loss, as represented above.</p>

  <p>The extraordinary rapidity with which a gun can be dislodged from
  its carriage, and every portion of its complicated machinery
  scattered upon the ground, is hardly to be believed unless witnessed;
  but the wonder is increased tenfold, on seeing with what magical
  celerity the death-dealing weapon can be put together again. These
  operations will be readily understood by an examination of the
  Illustrations. In that at the foot of page 175 the cannon is lying
  useless upon the earth; one wheel already forms the rude
  resting-place of a gunner, whilst the other is in the act of being
  displaced. By the application of a rope round the termination of the
  breech, and the lifting of the trail of the carriage, care being
  previously taken that the trunnions are in their respective sockets,
  a very slight exertion of manual labour is required to put the gun
  into fighting trim. That we may be understood, we will add that the
  trunnions are the short round pieces of iron, or brass, projecting
  from the sides of the cannon, and their relative position can be
  easily ascertained by a glance at the gun occupying the foreground of
  the Illustration where the dismantling is depicted. To perform the
  labour thus required in managing cannon, is called to serve the
  guns.</p>

  <p>Cannon are cast in a solid mass of metal, either of iron or brass;
  they are then bored by being placed upon a machine which causes the
  whole mass to turn round very rapidly. The boring tool being pressed
  against the cannon thus revolving, a deep hole is made in it, called
  the bore.</p>

  <h2>THE TREE KANGAROO AND BLACK LEOPARD.</h2>

  <p>The ordinary mode in which the Kangaroos make their way on the
  ground, as well as by flight from enemies, is by a series of bounds,
  often of prodigious extent. They spring from their hind limbs alone,
  using neither the tail nor the fore limbs. In feeding, they assume a
  crouching, hare-like position, resting on the fore paws as well as on
  the hinder extremities, while they browse on the herbage. In this
  attitude they hop gently along, the tail being pressed to the ground.
  On the least alarm they rise on the hind limbs, and bound to a
  distance with great rapidity. Sometimes, when excited, the old male
  of the great kangaroo stands on tiptoe and on his tail, and is then
  of prodigious height. It readily takes to the water, and swims well,
  often resorting to this mode of escape from its enemies, among which
  is the dingo, or wild dog of Australia.</p>

  <div class="illustration">

    <a name="image-0185"></a> <img src="img/0185.jpg" alt=
    "Tree Kangaroo, and Black Leopard.">
  </div>

  <p>Man is, however, the most unrelenting foe of this inoffensive
  animal. It is a native of New Holland and Van Diemen&#39;s Land, and
  was first discovered by the celebrated navigator Captain Cook, in
  1770, while stationed on the coast of New South Wales. In Van
  Diemen&#39;s Land the great kangaroo is regularly hunted with
  fox-hounds, as the deer or fox in England.</p>

  <p>The Tree Kangaroo, in general appearance, much resembles the
  common kangaroo, having many of that animal&#39;s peculiarities. It
  seems to have the power of moving very quickly on a tree; sometimes
  holding tight with its fore feet, and bringing its hind feet up
  together with a jump; at other times climbing ordinarily.</p>
  <hr class="short">

  <p>In the island of Java a black variety of the Leopard is not
  uncommon, and such are occasionally seen in our menageries; they are
  deeper than the general tint, and the spots show in certain lights
  only. Nothing can exceed the grace and agility of the leopards; they
  bound with astonishing ease, climb trees, and swim, and the
  flexibility of the body enables them to creep along the ground with
  the cautious silence of a snake on their unsuspecting prey.</p>

  <p>In India the leopard is called by the natives the
  &quot;tree-tiger,&quot; from its generally taking refuge in a tree
  when pursued, and also from being often seen among the branches: so
  quick and active is the animal in this situation, that it is not easy
  to take a fair aim at him. Antelopes, deer, small quadrupeds, and
  monkeys are its prey. It seldom attacks a man voluntarily, but, if
  provoked, becomes a formidable assailant. It is sometimes taken in
  pitfalls and traps. In some old writers there are accounts of the
  leopard being taken in trap, by means of a mirror, which, when the
  animal jump against it, brings a door down upon him.</p>

  <p>Sardis, the ancient capital of the kingdom of Lydia, is situated
  on the river Pactolus, in the fertile plain below Mount Tmolus.
  Wealth, pomp, and luxury characterised this city from very ancient
  times. The story of Croesus, its last King, is frequently alluded to
  by historians, as affording a remarkable example of the instability
  of human greatness. This Monarch considered himself the happiest of
  human beings, but being checked by the philosopher Solon for his
  arrogance, he was offended, and dismissed the sage from his Court
  with disgrace. Not long afterwards, led away by the ambiguous answers
  of the oracles, he conducted a large army into the field against
  Cyrus, the future conqueror of Babylon, but was defeated, and obliged
  to return to his capital, where he shut himself up. Hither he was
  soon followed and besieged by Cyrus, with a far inferior force; but,
  at the expiration of fourteen days, the citadel, which had been
  deemed impregnable, was taken by a stratagem, and Croseus was
  condemned to the flames. When the sentence was about to be executed,
  he was heard to invoke the name of Solon, and the curiosity of Cyrus
  being excited, he asked the cause; and, having heard his narrative,
  ordered him to be set free, and subsequently received him into his
  confidence.</p><!-- [Illustration: SARDIS.] -->

  <div class="illustration">
    <a name="image-0189"></a> <img src="img/0189.jpg" alt="Sardis.">
  </div>

  <p>Under the Romans, Sardis declined in importance, and, being
  destroyed by an earthquake, for some time lay desolate, until it was
  rebuilt by the Roman Emperor Tiberius.</p>

  <p>The situation of Sardis is very beautiful, but the country over
  which it looks is almost deserted, and the valley is become a swamp.
  The hill of the citadel, when seen from the opposite bank of the
  Hermus, appears of a triangular form; and at the back of it rise
  ridge after ridge of mountains, the highest covered with snow, and
  many of them bearing evident marks of having been jagged and
  distorted by earthquakes. The citadel is exceedingly difficult of
  ascent; but the magnificent view which it commands of the plain of
  the Hermus, and other objects of interest, amply repays the risk and
  fatigue. The village, small as it is, boasts of containing one of the
  most remarkable remains of antiquity in Asia; namely, the vast Ionic
  temple of the heathen goddess Cybele, or the earth, on the banks of
  the Pactolus. In 1750, six columns of this temple were standing, but
  four of them have since been thrown down by the Turks, for the sake
  of the gold which they expected to find in the joints.</p>

  <p>Two or three mills and a few mud huts, inhabited by Turkish
  herdsmen, contain all the present population of Sardis.</p>

  <p>At a time when there appeared to be good reason for believing that
  the invasion of England was contemplated, the Government turned their
  attention to the defence of such portions of the coast as seemed to
  present the greatest facility for the landing of a hostile force. As
  the Kentish coast, from East Were Bay to Dymchurch, seemed more
  especially exposed, a line of Martello Towers was erected between
  these two points, at a distance from each other of from one-quarter
  to three-quarters of a mile. Other towers of the same kind were
  erected on various parts of the coast where the shore was low, in
  other parts of England, but more particularly in the counties of
  Sussex and Suffolk. Towers of this construction appear to have been
  adopted, owing to the resistance that was made by the Tower of
  Martella, in the Island of Corsica, to the British forces under Lord
  Hood and General Dundas, in 1794. This tower which was built in the
  form of an obtruncated cone&mdash;like the body of a
  windmill&mdash;was situated in Martella, or Martle Bay. As it
  rendered the landing of the troops difficult, Commodore Linzee
  anchored in the bay to the westward, and there landed the troops on
  the evening of the 7th of February, taking possession of a height
  that commanded the tower. As the tower impeded the advance of the
  troops, it was the next day attacked from the bay by the vessels
  <i>Fortitude</i> and <i>Juno</i>; but after a cannonade of two hours
  and a half, the ships were obliged to haul off, the <i>Fortitude</i>
  having sustained considerable damage from red-hot shot discharged
  from the tower. The tower, after having been cannonaded from the
  height for two days, surrendered; rather, it would appear, from the
  alarm of the garrison, than from any great injury that the tower had
  sustained. The English, on taking possession of the fort, found that
  the garrison had originally consisted of thirty-three men, of whom
  two only were wounded, though mortally. The walls were of great
  thickness, and bomb-proof; and the parapet consisted of an interior
  lining of rush matting, filled up to the exterior of the parapet with
  sand. The only guns they had were two 18-pounders.</p>

  <p>The towers erected between East Were Bay and Dymchurch (upwards of
  twenty) were built of brick, and were from about 35 feet to 40 feet
  high: the entrance to them was by a low door-way, about seven feet
  and a half from the ground; and admission was gained by means of a
  ladder, which was afterwards withdrawn into the interior. A high step
  of two feet led to the first floor of the tower, a room of about
  thirteen feet diameter, and with the walls about five feet thick.
  Round this room were loopholes in the walls, at such an elevation,
  that the men would be obliged to stand on benches in the event of
  their being required to oppose an attack of musketry. Those benches
  were also used as the sleeping-places of the garrison. On this floor
  there was a fire-place, and from the centre was a trap-door leading
  downwards to the ammunition and provision rooms. The second floor was
  ascended by similar means.</p>

  <p>Characteristically indolent, the fondness for a sedentary life is
  stronger, perhaps, with the Turks, than with any other people of whom
  we read. It is difficult to describe the gravity and apathy which
  constitute the distinguishing features of their character: everything
  in their manners tends to foster in them, especially in the higher
  classes, an almost invincible love of ease and luxurious leisure. The
  general rule which they seem to lay down for their guidance, is that
  taking the trouble to do anything themselves which they can possibly
  get others to do for them; and the precision with which they observe
  it in some of the minutest trifles of domestic life is almost
  amusing. A Turkish gentleman, who has once composed his body upon the
  corner of a sofa, appears to attach a certain notion of grandeur to
  the keeping of it there, and it is only something of the gravest
  importance that induces him to disturb his position. If he wishes to
  procure anything that is within a few steps of him, he summons his
  slaves by clapping his hands (the Eastern mode of &quot;ringing the
  bell&quot;), and bids them bring it to him: his feelings of dignity
  would be hurt by getting up to reach it himself. Of course, this
  habit of inac tion prevails equally with the female sex: a Turkish
  lady would not think of picking up a fallen handkerchief, so long as
  she had an attendant to do it for her. As may be supposed, the number
  of slaves in a Turkish household of any importance is very great.</p>

  <p>The position of women in Eastern countries is so totally unlike
  that which they hold in our own happy land, that we must refer
  expressly to it, in order that the picture of domestic life presented
  to us in the writings of all travellers in the East may be
  understood. Amongst all ranks, the wife is not the friend and
  companion, but the slave of her husband; and even when treated with
  kindness and affection, her state is still far below that of her
  sisters in Christian lands. Even in the humblest rank of life, the
  meal which the wife prepares with her own hands for her husband, she
  must not partake of with him. The hard-working Eastern peasant, and
  the fine lady who spends most of her time in eating sweet-meats, or
  in embroidery, are both alike dark and ignorant; for it would be
  accounted a folly, if not a sin, to teach them even to read.</p>

  <p>Numerous carriers, or sellers of water, obtain their living in the
  East by supplying the inhabitants with it. They are permitted to fill
  their water-bags, made of goat-skins, at the public fountains. This
  goat-skin of the carrier has a long brass spout, and from this the
  water is poured into a brass cup, for any one who wishes to drink.
  Many of these are employed by the charitable, to distribute water in
  the streets; and they pray the thirsty to partake of the bounty
  offered to them in the name of God, praying that Paradise and pardon
  may be the lot of him who affords the refreshing gift.</p>

  <p>The Dancing Dervises are a religious order of Mohamedans, who
  affect a great deal of patience, humility, and charity. Part of their
  religious observance consists in dancing or whirling their bodies
  round with the greatest rapidity imaginable, to the sound of a flute;
  and long practice has enabled them to do this without suffering the
  least inconvenience from the strange movement.</p>

  <p>In Eastern countries, the bread is generally made in the form of a
  large thin cake, which is torn and folded up, almost like a sheet of
  paper; it can then be used (as knives and forks are not employed by
  the Orientals) for the purpose of rolling together a mouthful of
  meat, or supping up gravy and vegetables, at the meals.</p>

  <h2>ON STUDY.</h2>

  <p>Studies serve for delight, for ornament, and for ability. The
  chief use for delight is in privateness and retiring; for ornament,
  is in discourse; and for ability, is in the judgment and disposition
  of business. For expert men can execute, and perhaps judge of
  particulars one by one; but the general counsels, and the plots, and
  marshalling of affairs, come best from those that are learned. To
  spend too much time in studies, is sloth; to use them too much for
  ornament, is affectation; to make judgment wholly by their rules, is
  the humour of a scholar. They perfect nature, and are perfected by
  experience; for natural abilities are like natural plants, that need
  pruning by duty; and studies themselves do give forth directions too
  much at large, except they be bounded in by experience. Crafty men
  contemn studies, simple men admire them, and wise men use them: for
  they teach not their own use, but that is a wisdom without them, and
  above them, won by observation. Read not to contradict and confute,
  nor to believe and take for granted; not to find talk and discourse,
  but to weigh and consider. Some books are to be tasted, others to be
  swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested: that is, some
  books are to be read only in parts; others to be read, but not
  curiously; and some few to be read wholly, and with diligence and
  attention. Some books also may be read by deputy, and extracts made
  of them by others; but that should be only in the less important
  arguments, and the meaner sorts of books; else distilled books are
  like common distilled waters, flashy things. Reading maketh a full
  man; conference a ready man; and writing an exact man. And,
  therefore, if a man write little, he had need have a great memory; if
  he confer little, he had need have a present wit; and if he read
  little, he had need have much cunning, to seem to know that he doth
  not.</p>

  <h2>THE FORT OF ATTOCK.</h2><!-- [Illustration: Letter A] -->

  <p>Attock is a fort and small town in the Punjaub, on the left or
  east bank of the Indus, 942 miles from the sea, and close below the
  place where it receives the water of the Khabool river, and first
  becomes navigable. The name, signifying <i>obstacle</i>, is supposed
  to have been given to it under the presumption that no scrupulous
  Hindoo would proceed westward of it; but this strict principle, like
  many others of similar nature, is little acted on. Some state that
  the name was given by the Emperor Akbar, because he here found much
  difficulty in crossing the river. The river itself is at this place
  frequently by the natives called Attock. Here is a bridge, formed
  usually of from twenty to thirty boats, across the stream, at a spot
  where it is 537 feet wide. In summer, when the melting of the snows
  in the lofty mountains to the north raises the stream so that the
  bridge becomes endangered, it is withdrawn, and the communication is
  then effected by means of a ferry.</p>

  <p>The banks of the river are very high, so that the enormous
  accession which the volume of water receives during inundation
  scarcely affects the breadth, but merely increases the depth. The
  rock forming the banks is of a dark-coloured slate, polished by the
  force of the stream, so as to shine like black marble. Between these,
  &quot;one clear blue stream shot past.&quot; The depth of the Indus
  here is thirty feet in the lowest state, and between sixty and
  seventy in the highest, and runs at the rate of six miles an hour.
  There is a ford at some distance above the confluence of the river of
  Khabool; but the extreme coldness and rapidity of the water render it
  at all times very dangerous, and on the slightest inundation quite
  impracticable. The bridge is supported by an association of boatmen,
  who receive the revenue of a village allotted for this purpose by the
  Emperor Akbar, and a small daily pay as long as the bridge stands,
  and also levy a toll on all passengers.</p>

  <p>On the right bank, opposite Attock, is Khyrabad&mdash;a fort
  built, according to some, by the Emperor Akbar, according to others
  by Nadir Shah. This locality is, in a military and commercial point
  of view, of much importance, as the Indus is here crossed by the
  great route which, proceeding from Khabool eastward through the
  Khyber Pass into the Punjaub, forms the main line of communication
  between Affghanistan and Northern India. The river was here
  repeatedly crossed by the British armies, during the late military
  operations in Affghanistan; and here, according to the general
  opinion, Alexander, subsequently Timur, the Tartar conqueror, and,
  still later, Nadir Shah, crossed; but there is much uncertainty on
  these points.</p><!-- [Illustration: THE FORT OF ATTOCK.] -->

  <p>The fortress was erected by the Emperor Akbar, in 1581 to command
  the passage; but, though strongly built of stone on the high and
  steep bank of the river, it could offer no effectual resistance to a
  regular attack, being commanded by the neighbouring heights. Its form
  is that of a parallelogram: it is 800 yards long and 400 wide. The
  population of the town, which is inclosed within the walls of the
  fort, is estimated at 2000.</p>

  <p>This celebrated statesman, who flourished in the reigns of Charles
  I. and II., took a prominent part in the eventful times in which he
  lived. He was not of noble birth, but the descendant of a family
  called Hyde, which resided from a remote period at Norbury, in
  Cheshire. He was originally intended for the church, but eventually
  became a lawyer, applying himself to the study of his profession with
  a diligence far surpassing that of the associates with whom he lived.
  In 1635, he attracted the notice of Archbishop Laud, which may be
  regarded as the most fortunate circumstance of his life, as it led to
  his introduction to Charles I. In consequence of the ability
  displayed by him in the responsible duties he was called to perform,
  that Monarch offered him the office of Solicitor-General. But this
  Hyde declined, preferring, as he said, to serve the King in an
  unofficial capacity. After the battle of Naseby, Hyde was appointed
  one of the council formed to attend, watch over, and direct the
  Prince of Wales. After hopelessly witnessing for many months a course
  of disastrous and ill-conducted warfare in the West, the council fled
  with the Prince, first to the Scilly Islands, near Cornwall, and
  thence to Jersey. From this place, against the wishes of Hyde, the
  Prince, in 1640, repaired to his mother, Henrietta, at Paris, leaving
  Hyde at Jersey, where he remained for two years, engaged in the
  composition of his celebrated &quot;History of the Rebellion.&quot;
  In May, 1648, Hyde was summoned to attend the Prince at the Hague;
  and here they received the news of the death of Charles I., which is
  said to have greatly appalled them. After faithfully following the
  new King in all his vicissitudes of fortune, suffering at times
  extreme poverty, he attained at the Restoration the period of his
  greatest power. In 1660, his daughter Anne was secretly married to
  the Duke of York; but when, after a year, it was openly acknowledged,
  the new Lord Chancellor received the news with violent demonstrations
  of indignation and grief. Hyde, in fact, never showed any avidity for
  emoluments or distinction; but when this marriage was declared, it
  became desirable that some mark of the King&#39;s favour should be
  shown, and he was created Earl of Clarendon. He subsequently, from
  political broils, was compelled to exile himself from the Court, and
  took up his residence at Montpellier, where, resuming his literary
  labours, he completed his celebrated History, and the memoir of his
  life. After fruitlessly petitioning King Charles II. for permission
  to end his days in England, the illustrious exile died at Rouen, in
  1674, in the sixty-fifth year of his age.</p>

  <p>It is now generally known that the Owl renders the farmer
  important service, by ridding him of vermin, which might otherwise
  consume the produce of his field; but in almost every age and country
  it has been regarded as a bird of ill omen, and sometimes even as the
  herald of death. In France, the cry or hoot is considered as a
  certain forerunner of misfortune to the hearer. In Tartary, the owl
  is looked upon in another light, though not valued as it ought to be
  for its useful destruction of moles, rats, and mice. The natives pay
  it great respect, because they attribute to this bird the
  preservation of the founder of their empire, Genghis Khan. That
  Prince, with his army, happened to be surprised and put to flight by
  his enemies, and was forced to conceal himself in a little coppice.
  An owl settled on the bush under which he was hid, and his pursuers
  did not search there, as they thought it impossible the bird would
  perch on a place where any man was concealed. Thenceforth his
  countrymen held the owl to be a sacred bird, and every one wore a
  plume of its feathers on his head.</p>

  <p>One of the smallest of the owl tribe utters but one melancholy
  note now and then. The Indians in North America whistle whenever they
  chance to hear the solitary note; and if the bird does not very soon
  repeat his harmless cry, the speedy death of the superstitious hearer
  is foreboded. It is hence called the death bird. The voices of all
  carnivorous birds and beasts are harsh, and at times hideous; and
  probably, like that of the owl, which, from the width and capacity of
  its throat, is in some varieties very powerful, may be intended as an
  alarm and warning to the birds and animals on which they prey, to
  secure themselves from the approach of their stealthy foe.</p>

  <p>Owls are divided into two groups or families&mdash;one having two
  tufts of feathers on the head, which have been called ears or horns,
  and are moveable at pleasure, the others having smooth round heads
  without tufts. The bills are hooked in both. There are upwards of
  sixty species of owls widely spread over almost every part of the
  known world; of these we may count not fewer than eight as more or
  less frequenting this country. One of the largest of the tribe is the
  eagle hawk, or great horned owl, the great thickness of whose plumage
  makes it appear nearly as large as the eagle. Some fine preserved
  specimens of this noble-looking bird may be seen in the British
  Museum. It is a most powerful bird; and a specimen was captured, with
  great difficulty, in 1837, when it alighted upon the mast-head of a
  vessel off Flamborough-head.</p>

  <p>The amiable naturalist, Mr. Waterton, who took especial interest
  in the habits of the owl, writes thus on the barn
  owl:&mdash;&quot;This pretty aerial wanderer of the night often comes
  into my room, and, after flitting to and fro, on wing so soft and
  silent that he is scarcely heard, takes his departure from the same
  window at which he had entered. I own I have a great liking for the
  bird; and I have offered it hospitality and protection on account of
  its persecutions, and for its many services to me; I wish that any
  little thing I could write or say might cause it to stand better with
  the world than it has hitherto done.&quot;</p>

  <p>This gifted young poet was the son of a schoolmaster at Bristol,
  where he was born, in 1752. On the 24th of August, 1770, he was found
  dead, near a table covered with the scraps of writings he had
  destroyed, in a miserable room in Brook-street, Holborn. In Redcliffe
  churchyard, Bristol, a beautiful monument has been erected to the
  memory of the unfortunate poet.</p>

  <p>This city and sea-port of Natolia, in Asia, is situate towards the
  northern part of a peninsula, upon a long and winding gulf of the
  same name, which is capable of containing the largest navy in the
  world. The city is about four miles round, presenting a front of a
  mile long to the water; and when approached by sea, it resembles a
  capacious amphitheatre with the ruins of an ancient castle crowning
  its summit. The interior of the city, however, disappoints the
  expectations thus raised, for the streets are narrow, dirty, and
  ill-paved, and there is now scarcely a trace of those once splendid
  edifices which rendered Smyrna one of the finest cities in Asia
  Minor. The shops are arched over, and have a handsome appearance: in
  spite of the gloom which the houses wear, those along the shore have
  beautiful gardens attached to them, at the foot of which are
  summer-houses overhanging the sea. The city is subject to earthquakes
  and the plague, which latter, in 1814, carried off above 50,000 of
  the inhabitants.</p>

  <p>About midnight, in July, 1841, a fire broke out at Smyrna, which,
  from the crowded state of the wooden houses, the want of water, and
  the violence of the wind, was terribly destructive. About 12,000
  houses were destroyed, including two-thirds of the Turkish quarter,
  most of the French and the whole of the Jewish quarters, with many
  bazaars and several mosques, synagogues, and other public buildings.
  It was calculated that 20,000 persons were deprived of shelter and
  food, and the damage was estimated at two millions sterling.</p>

  <p>The fine port of Smyrna is frequented by ships from all nations,
  freighted with valuable cargoes, both outward and inward. The greater
  part of the trading transactions is managed by Jews, who act as
  brokers, the principals meeting afterwards to conclude the
  bargains.</p>

  <p>In 1402 Smyrna was taken by Tamerlane, and suffered very severely.
  The conqueror erected within its walls a tower constructed of stones
  and the heads of his enemies. Soon after, it came under the dominion
  of the Turks, and has been subsequently the most flourishing city in
  the Levant, exporting and importing valuable commodities to and from
  all parts of the world.</p><!-- **** -->

  <h2>GENTLENESS.</h2><!-- [Illustration: Letter I] -->

  <div class="decoration">

  </div>

  <p>I begin with distinguishing true gentleness from passive tameness
  of spirit, and from unlimited compliance with the manners of others.
  That passive tameness which submits, without opposition, to every
  encroachment of the violent and assuming, forms no part of Christian
  duty; but, on the contrary, is destructive of general happiness and
  order. That unlimited complaisance, which on every occasion falls in
  with the opinions and manners of others, is so far from being a
  virtue, that it is itself a vice, and the parent of many vices. It
  overthrows all steadiness of principle; and produces that sinful
  conformity with the world which taints the whole character. In the
  present corrupted state of human manners, always to assent and to
  comply is the very worst maxim we can adopt. It is impossible to
  support the purity and dignity of Christian morals without opposing
  the world on various occasions, even though we should stand alone.
  That gentleness, therefore, which belongs to virtue, is to be
  carefully distinguished from the mean spirit of cowards, and the
  fawning assent of sycophants. It renounces no just right from fear.
  It gives up no important truth from flattery. It is indeed not only
  consistent with a firm mind, but it necessarily requires a manly
  spirit, and a fixed principle, in order to give it any real value.
  Upon this solid ground only, the polish of gentleness can with
  advantage be superinduced.</p>

  <p>It stands opposed, not to the most determined regard for virtue
  and truth, but to harshness and severity, to pride and arrogance, to
  violence and oppression. It is properly that part of the great virtue
  of charity, which makes us unwilling to give pain to any of our
  brethren. Compassion prompts us to relieve their wants. Forbearance
  prevents us from retaliating their injuries. Meekness restrains our
  angry passions; candour, our severe judgments. Gentleness corrects
  whatever is offensive in our manners, and, by a constant train of
  humane attentions, studies to alleviate the burden of common misery.
  Its office, therefore, is extensive. It is not, like some other
  virtues, called forth only on peculiar emergencies; but it is
  continually in action, when we are engaged in intercourse with men.
  It ought to form our address, to regulate our speech, and to diffuse
  itself over our whole behaviour.</p>

  <p>We must not, however, confound this gentle &quot;wisdom which is
  from above&quot; with that artificial courtesy, that studied
  smoothness of manners, which is learned in the school of the world.
  Such accomplishments the most frivolous and empty may possess. Too
  often they are employed by the artful as a snare; too often affected
  by the hard and unfeeling as a cover to the baseness of their minds.
  We cannot, at the same time, avoid observing the homage, which, even
  in such instances, the world is constrained to pay to virtue. In
  order to render society agreeable, it is found necessary to assume
  somewhat that may at least carry its appearance. Virtue is the
  universal charm. Even its shadow is courted, when the substance is
  wanting. The imitation of its form has been reduced into an art; and
  in the commerce of life, the first study of all who would either gain
  the esteem or win the hearts of others, is to learn the speech and to
  adopt the manners of candour, gentleness, and humanity. But that
  gentleness which is the characteristic of a good man has, like every
  other virtue, its seat in the heart; and let me add, nothing except
  what flows from the heart can render even external manners truly
  pleasing. For no assumed behaviour can at all times hide the real
  character. In that unaffected civility which springs from a gentle
  mind there is a charm infinitely more powerful than in all the
  studied manners of the most finished courtier.</p>

  <p>True gentleness is founded on a sense of what we owe to HIM who
  made us, and to the common nature of which we all share. It arises
  from reflections on our own failings and wants, and from just views
  of the condition and the duty of man. It is native feeling heightened
  and improved by principle. It is the heart which easily relents;
  which feels for every thing that is human, and is backward and slow
  to inflict the least wound. It is affable in its address, and mild in
  its demeanour; ever ready to oblige, and willing to be obliged by
  others; breathing habitual kindness towards friends, courtesy to
  strangers, long-suffering to enemies. It exercises authority with
  moderation; administers reproof with tenderness; confers favours with
  ease and modesty. It is unassuming in opinion, and temperate in zeal.
  It contends not eagerly about trifles; slow to contradict, and still
  slower to blame; but prompt to allay dissension and to restore peace.
  It neither intermeddles unnecessarily with the affairs, nor pries
  inquisitively into the secrets of others. It delights above all
  things to alleviate distress; and if it cannot dry up the falling
  tear, to sooth at least, the grieving heart. Where it has not the
  power of being useful, it is never burdensome. It seeks to please
  rather than to shine and dazzle, and conceals with care that
  superiority, either of talent or of rank, which is oppressive to
  those who are beneath it. In a word, it is that spirit and that
  tenour of manners which the Gospel of Christ enjoins, when it
  commands us &quot;to bear one another&#39;s burdens; to rejoice with
  those who rejoice, and to weep with those who weep; to please every
  one his neighbour for his good; to be kind and tender-hearted; to be
  pitiful and courteous; to support the weak, and to be patient towards
  all men.&quot;</p>

  <h2>THE IGUANA.</h2>

  <p>The Iguana (<i>Cyclura colei</i>) is not only of singular aspect,
  but it may be regarded as the type of a large and important group in
  the Saurian family, which formed so conspicuous a feature in the
  ancient fauna of this country. The iguana attains a large size in
  Jamaica, whence the present specimen was obtained, not unfrequently
  approaching four feet in length. In colour it is a greenish grey. It
  is entirely herbivorous, as are all its congeners. Its principal
  haunt in Jamaica is the low limestone chain of hills, along the shore
  from Kingston Harbour and Goat Island, on to its continuation in
  Vere.</p><!-- [Illustration: THE IGUANA] -->

    "The Iguana.">
  </div>

  <p>The iguanas which are occasionally taken in the savannahs adjacent
  to this district are considered by Mr. Hill (an energetic
  correspondent of the Zoological Society who resides in Spanish Town,
  and who has paid great attention to the natural history of the
  island) to be only stray visitants which have wandered from the
  hills. The allied species of <i>Cyclura</i>, which are found on the
  American continent, occur in situations of a very different
  character, for they affect forests on the bank of rivers, and woods
  around springs, where they pass their time in trees and in the water,
  living on fruits and leaves. This habit is preserved by the specimen
  in the Zoological Society&#39;s Gardens, which we have seen lying
  lazily along an elevated branch. Its serrated tail is a formidable
  weapon of defence, with which, when alarmed or attacked, it deals
  rapid blows from side to side. When unmolested it is harmless and
  inoffensive, and appears to live in perfect harmony with the smaller
  species of lizards which inhabit the same division of the house.</p>

  <p>how little did our immortal Bard think that this light fanciful
  offer of a &quot;fairy&quot; to &quot;the King of the Fairies&quot;
  would, in the nineteenth century, not only be substantially realised,
  but surpassed as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>The electric telegraph would convey intelligence more than
  twenty-eight thousand times round the earth, while Puck, at his
  vaunted speed, was crawling round it only ONCE!</p>

  <p>On every instrument there is a dial, on which are inscribed the
  names of the six or eight stations with which it usually
  communicates. When much business is to be transacted, a boy is
  necessary for each of these instruments; generally, however, one lad
  can, without practical difficulty, manage about three; but, as the
  whole of them are ready for work by night as well as by day, they are
  incessantly attended, in watches of eight hours each, by these
  satellite boys by day and by men at night.</p>

  <p>As fast as the various messages for delivery, flying one after
  another from the ground-floor up the chimney, reach the level of the
  instruments, they are brought by the superintendent to the particular
  one by which they are to be communicated; and its boy, with the
  quickness characteristic of his age, then instantly sets to work.</p>

  <p>His first process is by means of the electric current to sound a
  little bell, which simultaneously alarms all the stations on his
  line; and although the attention of the sentinel at each is thus
  attracted, yet it almost instantly evaporates from all excepting from
  that to the name of which he causes the electric needle to point, by
  which signal the clerk at that station instantly knows that the
  forthcoming question is addressed to <i>him</i>; and accordingly, by
  a corresponding signal, he announces to the London boy that he is
  ready to receive it. By means of a brass handle fixed to the dial,
  which the boy grasps in each hand, he now begins rapidly to spell off
  his information by certain twists of his wrists, each of which
  imparts to the needles on his dial, as well as to those on the dial
  of his distant correspondent, a convulsive movement designating the
  particular letter of the telegraphic alphabet required. By this
  arrangement he is enabled to transmit an ordinary-sized word in three
  seconds, or about twenty per minute. In the case of any accident to
  the wire of one of his needles, he can, by a different alphabet,
  transmit his message by a series of movements of the single needle,
  at the reduced rate of about eight or nine words per minute.</p>

  <p>While a boy at one instrument is thus occupied in transmitting
  to&mdash;say Liverpool, a message, written by its London author in
  ink which is scarcely dry, another boy at the adjoining instrument
  is, by the reverse of the process, attentively reading the quivering
  movements of the needles of his dial, which, by a sort of St.
  Vitus&#39;s dance, are rapidly spelling to him a message,
  <i>vi&acirc;</i> the wires of the South Western Railway, say from
  Gosport, which word by word he repeats aloud to an assistant, who,
  seated by his side, writes it down (he receives it about as fast as
  his attendant can conveniently write it); on a sheet of; paper,
  which, as soon as the message is concluded, descends to the
  &quot;booking-office.&quot; When inscribed in due form, it is without
  delay despatched to its destination, by messenger, cab, or express,
  according to order.</p>

  <p>The moon sometimes exhibits the extraordinary phenomenon of an
  iris or rainbow, by the refraction of her rays in drops of rain
  during the night-time. This appearance is said to occur only at the
  time of full moon, and to be indicative of stormy and rainy weather.
  One is described in the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i> as having
  been seen in 1810, during a thick rain; but, subsequent to that time,
  the same person gives an account of one which perhaps was the most
  extraordinary of which we have any record. It became visible about
  nine o&#39;clock, and continued, though with very different degrees
  of brilliancy, until past two. At first, though a strongly marked
  bow, it was without colour, but afterwards became extremely vivid,
  the red, green, and purple being the most strongly marked. About
  twelve it was the most splendid in appearance. The wind was very high
  at the time, and a drizzling rain falling occasionally.</p>

  <p>Hartlepool Lighthouse is a handsome structure of white
  freestone&mdash;the building itself being fifty feet in height; but,
  owing to the additional height of the cliff, the light is exhibited
  at an elevation of nearly eighty-five feet above high-water mark. On
  the eastern side of the building is placed a balcony, supporting a
  lantern, from which a small red light is exhibited, to indicate that
  state of the tide which will admit of the entrance of ships into the
  harbour; the corresponding signal in the daytime being a red ball
  hoisted to the top of the flag-staff. The lighthouse is furnished
  with an anemometer and tidal gauge; and its appointments are
  altogether of the most complete description. It is chiefly, however,
  with regard to the system adopted in the lighting arrangements that
  novelty presents itself.</p>

  <p>The main object, in the instance of a light placed as a beacon to
  warn mariners of their proximity to a dangerous coast, is to obtain
  the greatest possible intensity and amount of penetrating power. A
  naked or simple light is therefore seldom, if ever employed; but
  whether it proceed from the combustion of oil or gas, it is equally
  necessary that it should be combined with some arrangement of optical
  apparatus, in order that the rays emitted may be collected, and
  projected in such a direction as to render them available to the
  object in view; and in all cases a highly-polished metal surface is
  employed as a reflector.</p>

  <p>In the Hartlepool Lighthouse the illuminative medium is
  <i>gas</i>. The optical apparatus embraces three-fourths of the
  circumference of the circle which encloses the light, and the whole
  of the rays emanating from that part of the light opposed to the
  optical arrangement are reflected or refracted (as the case may be),
  so that they are projected from the lighthouse in such a direction as
  to be visible from the surface of the ocean.</p>

  <p>Can anything (says Plato) be more delightful than the hearing or
  the speaking of truth? For this reason it is that there is no
  conversation so agreeable that of a man of integrity, who hears
  without any intention to betray, and speaks without any intention to
  deceive. As an advocate was pleading the cause of his client in Rome,
  before one of the praetors, he could only produce a single witness in
  a point where the law required the testimony of two persons; upon
  which the advocate insisted on the integrity of the person whom he
  had produced, but the praetor told him that where the law required
  two witnesses he would not accept of one, though it were Cato
  himself. Such a speech, from a person who sat at the head of a court
  of justice, while Cato was still living, shows us, more than a
  thousand examples, the high reputation this great man had gained
  among his contemporaries on account of his sincerity.</p>

  <p>2. As I was sitting (says an ancient writer) with some senators of
  Bruges, before the gate of the Senate-House, a certain beggar
  presented himself to us, and with sighs and tears, and many
  lamentable gestures, expressed to us his miserable poverty, and asked
  our alms, telling us at the same time, that he had about him a
  private maim and a secret mischief, which very shame restrained him
  from discovering to the eyes of men. We all pitying the case of the
  poor man, gave him each of us something, and departed. One, however,
  amongst us took an opportunity to send his servant after him, with
  orders to inquire of him what that private infirmity might be which
  he found such cause to be ashamed of, and was so loth to discover.
  The servant overtook him, and delivered his commission: and after
  having diligently viewed his face, breast, arms, legs, and finding
  all his limbs in apparent soundness, &quot;Why, friend,&quot; said
  he, &quot;I see nothing whereof you have any such reason to
  complain.&quot; &quot;Alas! sir,&quot; said the beggar, &quot;the
  disease which afflicts me is far different from what you conceive,
  and is such as you cannot discern; yet it is an evil which hath crept
  over my whole body: it has passed through my very veins and marrow in
  such a manner that there is no member of my body that is able to work
  for my daily bread. This disease is by some called idleness, and by
  others sloth.&quot; The servant, hearing this singular apology, left
  him in great anger, and returned to his master with the above
  account; but before the company could send again to make further
  inquiry after him, the beggar had very prudently withdrawn
  himself.</p>

  <p>3. Action, we are assured, keeps the soul in constant health; but
  idleness corrupts and rusts the mind; for a man of great abilities
  may by negligence and idleness become so mean and despicable as to be
  an incumbrance to society and a burthen to himself. When the Roman
  historians described an extraordinary man, it generally entered into
  his character, as an essential, that he was <i>incredibili
  industri&acirc;, diligenti&acirc; singulari</i>&mdash;of incredible
  industry, of singular diligence and application. And Cato, in
  Sallust, informs the Senate, that it was not so much the arms as the
  industry of their ancestors, which advanced the grandeur of Rome, and
  made her mistress of the world.</p>

  <h2>RAFT OF GAMBIER ISLANDERS</h2>

  <p>The group in the Pacific Ocean called the Gambier Islands are but
  thinly inhabited, but possess a good harbour. Captain Beechey, in his
  &quot;Narrative of a Voyage to the Pacific and Behring&#39;s
  Straits,&quot; tells us that several of the islands, especially the
  largest, have a fertile appearance. The Captain gives an interesting
  account of his interview with some of the natives, who approached the
  ship in rafts, carrying from sixteen to twenty men each, as
  represented in the Engraving.</p>

  <p>&quot;We were much pleased,&quot; says the Captain, &quot;with the
  manner of lowering their matting sail, diverging on different
  courses, and working their paddles, in the use of which they had
  great power, and were well skilled, plying them together, or, to use
  a nautical phrase, &#39;keeping stroke.&#39; They had no other
  weapons but long poles, and were quite naked, with the exception of a
  banana leaf cut into strips, and tied about their loins; and one or
  two persons wore white turbans.&quot; They timidly approached both
  the ship and the barge, but would upset any small boats within their
  reach; not, however, from any malicious intention, but from
  thoughtlessness and inquisitiveness. Captain Beechey approached them
  in the gig, and gave them several presents, for which they, in
  return, threw him some bundles of paste, tied up in large leaves,
  which was the common food of the natives. They tempted the Captain
  and his crew with cocoa-nuts and roots, and invited their approach by
  performing ludicrous dances; but, as soon as the visitors were within
  reach, all was confusion. A scuffle ensued, and on a gun being fired
  over their heads, all but four instantly plunged into the sea. The
  inhabitants of these islands are stated to be well-made, with upright
  and graceful figures. Tattooing seems to be very commonly practised,
  and some of the patterns are described as being very elegant.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Winter in the Arctic Circle is winter indeed: there is no sun to
  gladden with his beams the hearts of the voyagers; but all is wrapt
  in darkness, day and night, save when the moon chances to obtrude her
  faint rays, only to make visible the desolation of the scene. The
  approach of winter is strongly marked. Snow begins to fall in August,
  and the ground is covered to the depth of two or three feet before
  October. As the cold augments, the air bears its moisture in the form
  of a frozen fog, the icicles of which are so sharp as to be painful
  to the skin. The surface of the sea steams like a lime-kiln, caused
  by the water being still warmer than the superincumbent atmosphere.
  The mist at last clears, the water having become frozen, and darkness
  settles on the land. All is silence, broken only by the bark of the
  Arctic fox, or by the loud explosion of bursting rocks, as the frost
  penetrates their bosoms.</p>

  <p>The crews of exploring vessels, which are frozen firmly in the ice
  in winter, spend almost the whole of their time in their ships, which
  in Sir James Ross&#39;s expedition (in 1848-49) were well warmed and
  ventilated. Where there has not been sufficient warmth, their
  provisions&mdash;even brandy&mdash;became so frozen as to require to
  be cut by a hatchet. The mercury in a barometer has frozen so that it
  might be beaten on an anvil.</p>

  <p>As Sir James Ross went in search of Sir John Franklin, he adopted
  various methods of letting him know (if alive) of assistance being at
  hand. Provisions were deposited in several marked places; and on the
  excursions to make these deposits, they underwent terrible fatigue,
  as well as suffered severely from what is termed &quot;snow
  blindness.&quot; But the greatest display of ingenuity was in
  capturing a number of white foxes, and fastening copper collars round
  their necks, on which was engraved a notice of the position of the
  ships and provisions. It was possible that these animals, which are
  known to travel very far in search of food, might be captured by the
  missing voyagers, who would thus be enabled to avail themselves of
  the assistance intended for them by their noble countrymen. The
  little foxes, in their desire to escape, sometimes tried to gnaw the
  bars of their traps; but the cold was so intense, that their tongues
  froze to the iron, and so their captors had to kill them, to release
  them from their misery, for they were never wantonly destroyed.</p>

  <p>The great Painter of the Universe has not forgotten the
  embellishment of the Pole. One of the most beautiful phenomena in
  nature is the Aurora Borealis, or northern lights. It generally
  assumes the form of an arch, darting flashes of lilac, yellow, or
  white light towards the heights of heaven. Some travellers state that
  the aurora are accompanied by a crackling or hissing noise; but
  Captain Lyon, who listened for hours, says that this is not the case,
  and that it is merely that the imagination cannot picture these
  sudden bursts of light as unaccompanied by noise.</p>

  <p>We will now bid farewell to winter, for with returning summer
  comes the open sea, and the vessels leave their wintry bed. This,
  however, is attended with much difficulty and danger. Canals have to
  be cut in the ice, through which to lead the ships to a less
  obstructed ocean; and, after this had been done in Sir James
  Ross&#39;s case, the ships were hemmed in by a pack of ice, fifty
  miles in circumference, and were carried along, utterly helpless, at
  the rate of eight or ten miles daily, for upwards of 250
  miles&mdash;the navigators fearing the adverse winds might drive them
  on the rocky coast of Baffin&#39;s Bay. At length the wind changed,
  and carried them clear of ice and icebergs (detached masses of ice,
  sometimes several hundred feet in height) to the open sea, and back
  to their native land.</p>

  <p>With all its dreariness, we owe much to the ice-bound Pole; to it
  we are indebted for the cooling breeze and the howling
  tempest&mdash;the beneficent tempest, in spite of all its desolation
  and woe. Evil and good in nature are comparative: the same thing does
  what is called harm in one sense, but incalculable good in another.
  So the tempest, that causes the wreck, and makes widows of happy
  wives and orphans of joyous children, sets in motion air that would
  else be stagnant, and become the breath of pestilence and the
  grave.</p><!-- [Illustration: MIDSUMMER NIGHT IN THE ARCTIC REGIONS.] -->

  <p>All the Crown Jewels, or Regalia, used by the Sovereign on great
  state occasions, are kept in the Tower of London, where they have
  been for nearly two centuries. The first express mention made of the
  Regalia being kept in this palatial fortress, occurs in the reign of
  Henry III., previously to which they were deposited either in the
  Treasury of the Temple, or in some religious house dependent upon the
  Crown. Seldom, however, did the jewels remain in the Tower for any
  length of time, for they were repeatedly pledged to meet the
  exigences of the Sovereign. An inventory of the jewels in the Tower,
  made by order of James I., is of great length; although Henry III.,
  during the Lincolnshire rebellion, in 1536, greatly reduced the value
  and number of the Royal store. In the reign of Charles II., a
  desperate attempt was made by Colonel Blood and his accomplices to
  possess themselves of the Royal Jewels.</p>

  <p>The Regalia were originally kept in a small building on the south
  side of the White Tower; but, in the reign of Charles I., they were
  transferred to a strong chamber in the Martin Tower, afterwards
  called the Jewel Tower. Here they remained until the fire in 1840;
  when being threatened with destruction from the flames which were
  raging near them, they were carried away by the warders, and placed
  for safety in the house of the Governor. In 1841 they were removed to
  the new Jewel-House, which is much more commodious than the old
  vaulted chamber in which they were previously shown.</p>

  <p>The QUEEN&#39;S, or IMPERIAL CROWN was made for the coronation of
  her present Majesty. It is composed of a cap of purple velvet,
  enclosed by hoops of silver, richly dight with gems, in the form
  shown in our Illustration. The arches rise almost to a point instead
  of being depressed, are covered with pearls, and are surmounted by an
  orb of brilliants. Upon this is placed a Maltese or cross pattee of
  brilliants. Four crosses and four <i>fleurs-de-lis</i> surmount the
  circlet, all composed of diamonds, the front cross containing the
  &quot;inestimable sapphire,&quot; of the purest and deepest azure,
  more than two inches long, and an inch broad; and, in the circlet
  beneath it, is a rock ruby, of enormous size and exquisite colour,
  <i>said</i> to have been worn by the Black Prince at the battle of
  Cressy, and by Henry V. at the battle of Agincourt. The circlet is
  enriched with diamonds, emeralds, sapphires, and rubies. This crown
  was altered from the one constructed expressly for the coronation of
  King George IV.: the superb diadem then weighed 5-1/2 lb., and was
  worn by the King on his return in procession from the Abbey to the
  Hall at Westminster.</p>

  <p>The OLD IMPERIAL CROWN (St. Edward&#39;s) is the one whose form is
  so familiar to us from its frequent representation on the coin of the
  realm, the Royal arms, &amp;c. It was made for the coronation of
  Charles II., to replace the one broken up and sold during the Civil
  Wars, which was said to have been worn by Edward the Confessor. It is
  of gold, and consists of two arches crossing at the top, and rising
  from a rim or circlet of gold, over a cap of crimson velvet, lined
  with white taffeta, and turned up with ermine. The base of the arches
  on each side is covered by a cross pattee; between the crosses are
  four <i>fleurs-de-lis</i> of gold, which rise out of the circle: the
  whole of these are splendidly enriched with pearls and precious
  stones. On the top, at the intersection of the arches, which are
  somewhat depressed, are a mound and cross of gold the latter richly
  jewelled, and adorned with three pearls, one on the top, and one
  pendent at each limb.</p>

  <p>The PRINCE OF WALES&#39;S CROWN is of pure gold, unadorned with
  jewels. On occasions of state, it is placed before the seat occupied
  by the Heir-Apparent to the throne in the House of Lords.</p>

  <p>The QUEEN&#39;S DIADEM was made for the coronation of Marie
  d&#39;Este, consort of James II., it is adorned with large diamonds,
  and the upper edge of the circlet is bordered with pearls.</p>

  <p>The TEMPORAL SCEPTRE of Queen Victoria is of gold, 2 feet 9 inch
  in length; the staff is very plain, but the pommel is ornamented with
  rubies, emeralds, and diamonds. The <i>fleurs-de-lis</i> with which
  this sceptre was originally adorned have been replaced by golden
  leaves, bearing the rose, shamrock, and thistle. The cross is
  variously jewelled, and has in the centre a large table diamond.</p>

  <p>Her Majesty&#39;s SPIRITUAL SCEPTRE, Rod of Equity, or Sceptre
  with the Dove, is also of gold, 3 feet 7 inches long, set with
  diamonds and other precious stones. It is surmounted by an orb,
  banded with rose diamonds, bearing a cross, on which is the figure of
  a dove with expanded wings.</p>

  <p>The QUEEN&#39;S IVORY SCEPTRE was made for Maria d&#39;Este,
  consort of James II. It is mounted in gold, and terminated by a
  golden cross, bearing a dove of white onyx.</p>

  <p>The ampulla is an antique vessel of pure gold, used for containing
  the holy oil at coronations. It resembles an eagle with expanded
  wings, and is finely chased: the head screws off at the middle of the
  neck for pouring in the oil; and the neck being hollow to the beak
  the latter serves as a spout, through which the consecrated oil is
  poured into</p>

  <p>The ANOINTING SPOON, which is also of pure gold: it has four
  pearls in the broadest part of the handle, and the bowl of the spoon
  is finely chased within and without; by its extreme thinness, it
  appears to be ancient.</p>

  <p>The ARMILLAE, or BRACELETS, are of solid fine gold, chased, 1-1/2
  inch in breadth, edged with rows of pearls. They open by a hinge, and
  are enamelled with the rose, <i>fleur-de-lis</i>, and harp.</p>

  <p>The IMPERIAL ORB, or MOUND, is an emblem of sovereignty, said to
  have been derived from Imperial Rome, and to have been first adorned
  with the cross by Constantine, on his conversion to Christianity. It
  first appears among the Royal insignia of England on the coins of
  Edward the Confessor. This orb is a ball of gold, 6 inches in
  diameter, encompassed with a band of gold, set with emeralds, rubies,
  and pearls. On the top is a remarkably fine amethyst, nearly 1-1/2
  inch high, which serves as the foot or pedestal of a rich cross of
  gold, 32 inches high, encrusted with diamonds; having in the centre,
  on one side, a sapphire, and an emerald on the other; four large
  pearls at the angles of the cross, a large pearl at the end of each
  limb, and three at the base; the height of the orb and cross being 11
  inches.</p>

  <p>The QUEEN&#39;S ORB is of smaller dimensions than the preceding,
  but of similar materials and fashion.</p>

  <p>The SALT-CELLARS are of singular form and rich workmanship. The
  most noticeable is&mdash;the <i>Golden Salt-cellar of State,</i>
  which is of pure gold, richly adorned with jewels, and grotesque
  figures in chased work. Its form is castellated: and the receptacles
  for the salt are formed by the removal of the tops of the
  turrets.</p>

  <p>In the same chamber with the Crowns, Sceptres, and other Regalia
  used in the ceremonial of the Coronation, is a very interesting
  collection ofAMPULLA plate, formerly used at Coronation festivals;
  together with fonts, &amp;c. Amongst these are</p>

  <p>The QUEEN&#39;S BAPTISMAL FONT, which is of silver, gilt,
  tastefully chased, and surmounted by two figures emblematical of the
  baptismal rite: this font was formerly used at the christening of the
  Royal family; but a new font of more picturesque design, has lately
  be n manufactured for her Majesty.</p>

  <h2>SIMPLICITY IN WRITING.</h2><!-- [Illustration: Letter F] -->

  <div class="decoration">
    <a name="image-0232"></a> <img src="img/0232.jpg" alt="Letter F.">
  </div>

  <p>Fine writing, according to Mr. Addison, consists of sentiments
  which are natural without being obvious. There cannot be a juster and
  more concise definition of fine writing.</p>

  <p>Sentiments which are merely natural affect not the mind with any
  pleasure, and seem not worthy to engage our attention. The
  pleasantries of a waterman, the observations of a peasant, the
  ribaldry of a porter or hackney-coachman; all these are natural and
  disagreeable. What an insipid comedy should we make of the chit-chit
  of the tea-table, copied faithfully and at full length! Nothing can
  please persons of taste but nature drawn with all her graces and
  ornament&mdash;<i>la belle nature</i>; or, if we copy low life, the
  strokes must be strong and remarkable, and must convey a lively image
  to the mind. The absurd <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> of Sancho Panza is
  represented in such inimitable colours by Cervantes, that it
  entertains as much as the picture of the most magnanimous hero or
  softest lover.</p>

  <p>The case is the same with orators, philosophers, critics, or any
  author who speaks in his own person without introducing other
  speakers or actors. If his language be not elegant, his observations
  uncommon, his sense strong and masculine, he will in vain boast his
  nature and simplicity. He may be correct, but he never will be
  agreeable. &#39;Tis the unhappiness of such authors that they are
  never blamed nor censured. The good fortune of a book and that of a
  man are not the same. The secret deceiving path of life, which Horace
  talks of&mdash;<i>fallentis semita vitae</i>&mdash;may be the
  happiest, lot of the one, but is the greatest misfortune that the
  other can possibly fall into.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, productions which are merely surprising,
  without being natural, can never give any lasting entertainment to
  the mind. To draw chimaeras is not, properly speaking, to copy or
  imitate. The justness of the representation is lost, and the mind is
  displeased to find a picture which bears no resemblance to any
  original. Nor are such excessive refinements more agreeable in the
  epistolary or philosophic style, than in the epic or tragic. Too much
  ornament is a fault in every kind of production. Uncommon
  expressions, strong flashes of wit, pointed similes, and epigrammatic
  turns, especially when laid too thick, are a disfigurement rather
  than any embellishment of discourse. As the eye, in surveying a
  Gothic building, is distracted by the multiplicity of ornaments, and
  loses the whole by its minute attention to the parts; so the mind, in
  perusing a work overstocked with wit, is fatigued and disgusted with
  the constant endeavour to shine and surprise. This is the case where
  a writer over-abounds in wit, even though that wit should be just and
  agreeable. But it commonly happens to such writers, that they seek
  for their favourite ornaments even where the subject affords them
  not; and by that means have twenty insipid conceits for one thought
  that is really beautiful.</p>

  <p>There is no subject in critical learning more copious than this of
  the just mixture of simplicity and refinement in writing; and,
  therefore, not to wander in too large a field, I shall confine myself
  to a few general observations on that head.</p>

  <p>First, I observe, &quot;That though excesses of both kinds are to
  be avoided, and though a proper medium ought to be studied in all
  productions; yet this medium lies not in a point, but admits of a
  very considerable latitude.&quot; Consider the wide distance, in this
  respect, between Mr. Pope and Lucretius. These seem to lie in the two
  greatest extremes of refinement and simplicity which a poet can
  indulge himself in, without being guilty of any blameable excess. All
  this interval may be filled with poets, who may differ from each
  other, but may be equally admirable, each in his peculiar style and
  manner. Corneille and Congreve, who carry their wit and refinement
  somewhat farther than Mr. Pope (if poets of so different a kind can
  be compared together), and Sophocles and Terence, who are more simple
  than Lucretius, seem to have gone out of that medium wherein the most
  perfect productions are to be found, and are guilty of some excess in
  these opposite characters. Of all the great poets, Virgil and Racine,
  in my opinion, lie nearest the centre, and are the farthest removed
  from both the extremities.</p>

  <p>My second observation on this head is, &quot;That it is very
  difficult, if not impossible, to explain by words wherein the just
  medium betwixt the excesses of simplicity and refinement consists, or
  to give any rule by which we can know precisely the bounds betwixt
  the fault and the beauty.&quot; A critic may not only discourse very
  judiciously on this head without instructing his readers, but even
  without understanding the matter perfectly himself. There is not in
  the world a finer piece of criticism than Fontenelle&#39;s
  &quot;Dissertation on Pastorals;&quot; wherein, by a number of
  reflections and philosophical reasonings, he endeavours to fix the
  just medium which is suitable to that species of writing. But let any
  one read the pastorals of that author, and he will be convinced, that
  this judicious critic, notwithstanding his fine reasonings, had a
  false taste, and fixed the point of perfection much nearer the
  extreme of refinement than pastoral poetry will admit of. The
  sentiments of his shepherds are better suited to the toilets of Paris
  than to the forests of Arcadia. But this it is impossible to discover
  from his critical reasonings. He blames all excessive painting and
  ornament, as much as Virgil could have done had he written a
  dissertation on this species of poetry. However different the tastes
  of men may be, their general discourses on these subjects are
  commonly the same. No criticism can be very instructive which
  descends not to particulars, and is not full of examples and
  illustrations. &#39;Tis allowed on all hands, that beauty, as well as
  virtue, lies always in a medium; but where this medium is placed is
  the great question, and can never be sufficiently explained by
  general reasonings.</p>

  <p>I shall deliver it as a third observation on this subject,
  &quot;That we ought to be more on our guard against the excess of
  refinement than that of simplicity; and that because the former
  excess is both less beautiful and more dangerous than the
  latter.&quot;</p>

  <p>It is a certain rule that wit and passion are entirely
  inconsistent. When the affections are moved, there is no place for
  the imagination. The mind of man being naturally limited, it is
  impossible all his faculties can operate at once; and the more any
  one predominates, the less room is there for the others to exert
  their vigour. For this reason a greater degree of simplicity is
  required in all compositions, where men and actions and passions are
  painted, than in such as consist of reflections and observations. And
  as the former species of writing is the more engaging and beautiful,
  one may safely, upon this account, give the preference to the extreme
  of simplicity above that of refinement.</p>

  <p>We may also observe, that those compositions which we read the
  oftenest, and which every man of taste has got by heart, have the
  recommendation of simplicity, and have nothing surprising in the
  thought when divested of that elegance of expression and harmony of
  numbers with which it is cloathed. If the merit of the composition
  lies in a point of wit, it may strike at first; but the mind
  anticipates the thought in the second perusal, and is no longer
  affected by it. When I read an epigram of Martial, the first line
  recalls the whole; and I have no pleasure in repeating to myself what
  I know already. But each line, each word in Catullus has its merit;
  and I am never tired with the perusal of him. It is sufficient to rim
  over Cowley once; but Parnel, after the fiftieth reading, is fresh as
  at the first. Besides, it is with books as with women, where a
  certain plainness of manner and of dress is more engaging than that
  glare of paint and airs and apparel which may dazzle the eye but
  reaches not the affections. Terence is a modest and bashful beauty,
  to whom we grant every thing, because he assumes nothing, and whose
  purity and nature make a durable though not a violent impression upon
  us.</p>

  <p>But refinement, as it is the less beautiful, so it is the more
  dangerous extreme, and what we are the aptest to fall into.
  Simplicity passes for dulness when it is not accompanied with great
  elegance and propriety. On the contrary, there is something
  surprising in a blaze of wit and conceit. Ordinary readers are
  mightily struck with it, and falsely imagine it to be the most
  difficult, as well as most excellent way of writing. Seneca abounds
  with agreeable faults, says Quinctilian&mdash;<i>abundat dulcibus
  vitiis</i>; and for that reason is the more dangerous and the more
  apt to pervert the taste of the young and inconsiderate.</p>

  <p>I shall add, that the excess of refinement is now more to be
  guarded against than ever; because it is the extreme which men are
  the most apt to fall into, after learning has made great progress,
  and after eminent writers have appeared in every species of
  composition. The endeavour to please by novelty leads men wide of
  simplicity and nature, and fills their writings with affectation and
  conceit. It was thus that the age of Claudius and Nero became so much
  inferior to that of Augustus in taste and genius; and perhaps there
  are at present some symptoms of a like degeneracy of taste, in France
  as well as in England.</p>

  <h2>JOHN HAMPDEN.</h2>

  <p>The celebrated patriot, John Hampden, was descended from an
  ancient family in Buckinghamshire, where he was born in 1594. On
  leaving the University, he entered the inns of court, where he made
  considerable progress in the study of the law. He was chosen to serve
  in the Parliament which assembled at Westminster, February, 1626, and
  served in all the succeeding Parliaments in the reign of Charles I.
  That Monarch having quarrelled with his Parliament, was obliged to
  have recourse to the open exercise of his prerogative in order to
  supply himself with money. From the nobility he desired assistance;
  from the City of London he required a loan of &pound;100,000. The
  former contributed but slowly; the latter at length gave a flat
  denial. To equip a fleet, an apportionment was made, by order of the
  Council, amongst all the maritime towns, each of which was required,
  with the assistance of the adjoining counties, to furnish a certain
  number of vessels or amount of shipping. The City of London was rated
  at twenty ships. And this was the first appearance in the present
  reign of ship-money&mdash;a taxation which had once been imposed by
  Elizabeth, on a great emergency, but which, revived and carried
  further by Charles, produced the most violent discontent.</p>

  <p>In 1636, John Hampden became universally known by his intrepid
  opposition to the ship-money, as an illegal tax. Upon this he was
  prosecuted, and his conduct throughout the transaction gained him
  great credit and reputation. When the Long Parliament began, the eyes
  of all were fixed upon him as the father of his country. On the 3rd
  of January, 1642, the King ordered articles of high treason, and
  other misdemeanours, to be prepared against Lord Kimbolton, Mr.
  Hampden, and four other members of the House of Commons, and went to
  the House to seize them, but they had retired. Mr. Hampden afterwards
  made a celebrated speech in the House to clear himself from the
  charge brought against him.</p>

  <p>In the beginning of the civil war Hampden commanded a regiment of
  foot, and did good service at the battle of Edgehill; but he received
  a mortal wound in an engagement with Prince Rupert, in
  Chalgrave-field, in Oxfordshire, and died in 1648. Hampden is said to
  have possessed in a high degree talents for gaining and preserving
  popular influence, and great courage, industry, and strength of mind,
  which procured him great ascendancy over other men.</p>

  <p>Verily duty to parents is of the first consequence; and would you,
  my young friends, recommend yourselves to the favour of your God and
  Father, would you imitate the example of your adorable Redeemer, and
  be made an inheritor of his precious promises; would you enjoy the
  peace and comforts of this life, and the good esteem of your
  fellow-creatures&mdash;Reverence your parents; and be it your
  constant endeavour, as it will be your greatest satisfaction, to
  witness your high sense of, and to make some returns for the
  obligations you owe to them, by every act of filial obedience and
  love.</p>

  <p>Let their commands be ever sacred in your ears, and implicitly
  obeyed, where they do not contradict the commands of God: pretend not
  to be wiser than they, who have had so much more experience than
  yourselves; and despise them not, if haply you should be so blest as
  to have gained a degree of knowledge or of fortune superior to them.
  Let your carriage towards them be always respectful, reverent, and
  submissive; let your words be always affectionate and humble, and
  especially beware of pert and ill-seeming replies; of angry,
  discontented, and peevish looks. Never imagine, if they thwart your
  wills, or oppose your inclinations, that this ariseth from any thing
  but love to you: solicitous as they have ever been for your welfare,
  always consider the same tender solicitude as exerting itself, even
  in cases most opposite to your desires; and let the remembrance of
  what they have done and suffered for you, ever preserve you from acts
  of disobedience, and from paining those good hearts which have
  already felt so much for you, their children.</p>

  <p>The Emperor of China, on certain days of the year, pays a visit to
  his mother, who is seated on a throne to receive him; and four times
  on his feet, and as often on his knees, he makes her a profound
  obeisance, bowing his head even to the ground.</p>

  <p>Sir Thomas More seems to have emulated this beautiful example;
  for, being Lord Chancellor of England at the same time that his
  father was a Judge of the King&#39;s Bench, he would always, on his
  entering Westminster Hall, go first to the King&#39;s Bench, and ask
  his father&#39;s blessing before he went to sit in the Court of
  Chancery, as if to secure success in the great decisions of his high
  and important office.</p>

  <p>When the widowed Mary, Queen of Scots, left France, where she had
  dwelt since her fifth year&mdash;where she had shared in the
  education of the French King&#39;s own daughters, in one of the
  convents of the kingdom, and been the idol of the French Court and
  people, it is said that, as the coast of the happy land faded from
  her view, she continued to exclaim, &quot;Farewell, France! farewell,
  dear France&mdash;I shall never see thee more!&quot; And her first
  view of Scotland only increased the poignancy of these touching
  regrets. So little pains had been taken to &quot;cover over the
  nakedness and poverty of the land,&quot; that tears sprang into her
  eyes, when, fresh from the elegant luxurious Court of Paris, she saw
  the wretched ponies, with bare, wooden saddles, or dirty and ragged
  trappings, which had been provided to carry her and her ladies from
  the water-side to Holyrood. And then the palace itself; how different
  from the palaces in which she had lived in France! Dismal and small,
  it consisted only of what is now the north wing. The state-room and
  the bed-chamber which were used by her yet remain, with the old
  furniture, and much of the needle-work there is said to have been the
  work of her hands. During her long and melancholy imprisonment in
  England, the art of needle-work and reading were almost her only mode
  of relieving the dreary hours.</p>

  <p>From the moment Mary of Scotland took the fatal resolution of
  throwing herself upon the supposed kindness and generosity of
  Elizabeth, her fate was sealed, and it was that of captivity, only to
  be ended by death. She was immediately cut off from all communication
  with her subjects, except such as it was deemed proper to allow; and
  was moved about from place to place, the better to ensure her safety.
  The hapless victim again and again implored Elizabeth to deal
  generously and justly with her. &quot;I came,&quot; said she, in one
  of her letters, &quot;of mine own accord; let me depart again with
  yours: and if God permit my cause to succeed, I shall be bound to you
  for it.&quot; But her rival was unrelenting, and, in fact, increased
  the rigours of her confinement. Whilst a prisoner at Chatsworth, she
  had been permitted the indulgence of air and exercise; and the bower
  of Queen Mary is still shown in the noble grounds of that place, as a
  favourite resort of the unfortunate captive. But even this absolutely
  necessary indulgence was afterwards denied; she was wholly confined
  to the Castle of Fotheringay, and a standing order was issued that
  &quot;she should be shot if she attempted to escape, or if others
  attempted to rescue her.&quot;</p>

  <hr class="long">

  <h2>TUBULAR RAILWAY BRIDGES.</h2>

  <p>In the year 1850, a vast line of railway was completed from
  Chester to Holyhead, for the conveyance of the Royal mails, of goods
  and passengers, and of her Majesty&#39;s troops and artillery,
  between London and Dublin&mdash;Holyhead being the most desirable
  point at which to effect this communication with Ireland. Upon this
  railway are two stupendous bridges, which are the most perfect
  examples of engineering skill ever executed in England, or in any
  other country.</p>

  <p>The first of these bridges carries the railway across the river
  Conway, close to the ancient castle built by Edward I. in order to
  bridle his new subjects, the Welsh.</p>

  <p>The Conway bridge consists of a tube, or long, huge chest, the
  ends of which rest upon stone piers, built to correspond with the
  architecture of the old castle. The tube is made of wrought-iron
  plates, varying in thickness from a quarter of an inch to one inch,
  riveted together, and strengthened by irons in the form of the letter
  T; and, to give additional strength to the whole, a series of cells
  is formed at the bottom and top of the tube, between an inner ceiling
  and floor and the exterior plates; the iron plates which form the
  cells being riveted and held in their places by angle irons. The
  space between the sides of the tube is 14 feet; and the height of the
  whole, inclusive of the cells, is 22 feet 3-1/2 inches at the ends,
  and 25 feet 6 inches at the centre. The total length of the tube is
  412 feet. One end of the tube is fixed to the masonry of the pier;
  but the other is so arranged as to allow for the expansion of the
  metal by changes of the temperature of the atmosphere, and it
  therefore, rests upon eleven rollers of iron, running upon a
  bed-plate; and, that the whole weight of the tube may not be carried
  by these rollers, six girders are carried over the tube, and riveted
  to the upper parts of its sides, which rest upon twelve balls of
  gun-metal running in grooves, which are fixed to iron beams let into
  the masonry.</p>

  <p>The second of these vast railway bridges crosses the Menai
  Straits, which separate Caernarvon from the island of Anglesey. It is
  constructed a good hundred feet above high-water level, to enable
  large vessels to sail beneath it; and in building it, neither
  scaffolding nor centering was used.</p>

  <p>The abutments on either side of the Straits are huge piles of
  masonry. That on the Anglesey side is 143 feet high, and 173 feet
  long. The wing walls of both terminate in splendid pedestals, and on
  each are two colossal lions, of Egyptian design; each being 25 feet
  long, 12 feet high though crouched, 9 feet abaft the body, and each
  paw 2 feet 1 inches. Each weighs 30 tons. The towers for supporting
  the tube are of a like magnitude with the entire work. The great
  Britannia Tower, in the centre of the Straits, is 62 feet by 52 feet
  at its base; its total height from the bottom, 230 feet; it contains
  148,625 cubic feet of limestone, and 144,625 of sandstone; it weighs
  20,000 tons; and there are 387 tons of cast iron built into it in the
  shape of beams and girders. It sustains the four ends of the four
  long iron tubes which span the Straits from shore to shore. The total
  quantity of stone contained in the bridge is 1,500,000 cubic feet.
  The side towers stand at a clear distance of 460 feet from the great
  central tower; and, again, the abutments stand at a distance from the
  side towers of 230 feet, giving the entire bridge a total length of
  1849 feet, correspond ing with the date of the year of its
  construction. The side or land towers are each 62 feet by 52 feet at
  the base, and 190 feet high; they contain 210 tons of cast iron.</p>
  <!-- [Illustration: CONWAY CASTLE AND TUBULAR BRIDGE.] -->

  <div class="illustration">
    <a name="image-0241"></a> <img src="img/0241.jpg" alt=
    "Conway Castle and Tubular Bridge.">
  </div>

  <p>The length of the great tube is exactly 470 feet, being 12 feet
  longer than the clear space between the towers, and the greatest span
  ever yet attempted. The greatest height of the tube is in the
  centre&mdash;30 feet, and diminishing towards the end to 22 feet.
  Each tube consists of sides, top and bottom, all formed of long,
  narrow wrought-iron plates, varying in length from 12 feet downward.
  These plates are of the same manufacture as those for making boilers,
  varying in thickness from three-eighths to three-fourths of an inch.
  Some of them weigh nearly 7 cwt., and are amongst the largest it is
  possible to roll with any existing machinery. The connexion between
  top, bottom, and sides is made much more substantial by triangular
  pieces of thick plate, riveted in across the corners, to enable the
  tube to resist the cross or twisting strain to which it will be
  exposed from the heavy and long-continued gales of wind that,
  sweeping up the Channel, will assail it in its lofty and unprotected
  position. The rivets, of which there are 2,000,000&mdash;each tube
  containing 327,000&mdash;are more than an inch in diameter. They are
  placed in rows, and were put in the holes red hot, and beaten with
  heavy hammers. In cooling, they contracted strongly, and drew the
  plates together so powerfully that it required a force of from 1 to 6
  tons to each rivet, to cause the plates to slide over each other. The
  weight of wrought iron in the great tube is 1600 tons.</p>

  <p>Each of these vast bridge tubes was constructed on the shore, then
  floated to the base of the piers, or bridge towers, and raised to its
  proper elevation by hydraulic machinery, the largest in the world,
  and the most powerful ever constructed. For the Britannia Bridge,
  this consisted of two vast presses, one of which has power equal to
  that of 30,000 men, and it lifted the largest tube six feet in half
  an hour.</p>

  <p>The Britannia tubes being in two lines, are passages for the up
  and down trains across the Straits. Each of the tubes has been
  compared to the Burlington Arcade, in Piccadilly; and the labour of
  placing this tube upon the piers has been assimilated to that of
  raising the Arcade upon the summit of the spire of St. James&#39;s
  Church, if surrounded with water.</p>

  <p>Each line of tube is 1513 feet in length; far surpassing in size
  any piece of wrought-iron work ever before put together; and its
  weight is 5000 tons, being nearly equal to that of two 120-gun ships,
  having on board, ready for sea, guns, provisions, and crew. The
  plate-iron covering of the tubes is not thicker than the hide of an
  elephant, and scarcely thicker than the bark of an oak-tree; whilst
  one of the large tubes, if placed on its end in St. Paul&#39;s
  churchyard, would reach 107 feet higher than the cross of the
  cathedral.</p>

  <h2>KAFFIR LETTER-CARRIER.</h2>

  <p>&quot;I knew&quot; (says the pleasing writer of &quot;Letters from
  Sierra Leone&quot;) &quot;that the long-looked-for vessel had at
  length furled her sails and dropped anchor in the bay. She was from
  England, and I waited, expecting every minute to feast my eyes upon
  at least one letter; but I remembered how unreasonable it was to
  suppose that any person would come up with letters to this lonely
  place at so late an hour, and that it behoved me to exercise the
  grace of patience until next day. However, between ten and eleven
  o&#39;clock, a loud shouting and knocking aroused the household, and
  the door was opened to a trusty Kroo messenger, who, although one of
  a tribe who would visit any of its members in their own country with
  death, who could &#39;savey white man&#39;s book,&#39; seemed to
  comprehend something of our feelings at receiving letters, as I
  overheard him exclaim, with evident glee, &#39;Ah! massa! here de
  right book come at last.&#39; Every thing, whether a brown-paper
  parcel, a newspaper, an official despatch, a private letter or note
  is here denominated a &#39;book,&#39; and this man understood well
  that newspapers are never received so gladly amongst &#39;books&#39;
  from England as letters.&quot; The Kaffir, in the Engraving, was
  sketched from one employed to convey letters in the South African
  settlements; he carries his document in a split at the end of a
  cane.</p><!-- [Illustration: KAFFIR LETTER-CARRIER.] -->

  <p>It is a singular sight in India to see the catamarans which put
  off from some parts of the coast, as soon as ships come in sight,
  either to bear on board or to convey from thence letters or messages.
  These frail vessels are composed of thin cocoa-tree logs, lashed
  together, and big enough to carry one, or, at most, two persons. In
  one of these a small sail is fixed, and the navigator steers with a
  little paddle; the float itself is almost entirely sunk in the water,
  so that the effect is very singular&mdash;a sail sweeping along the
  surface with a man behind it, and apparently nothing to support them.
  Those which have no sails are consequently invisible and the men have
  the appearance of treading the water and performing evolutions with a
  racket. In very rough weather the men lash themselves to their little
  rafts but in ordinary seas they seem, though frequently washed off,
  to regard such accidents as mere trifles, being naked all but a wax
  cloth cap in which they keep any letters they may have to convey to
  ships in the roads, and swimming like fish. Their only danger is from
  sharks, which are said to abound. These cannot hurt them while on
  their floats; but woe be to them if they catch them while separated
  from that defence. Yet, even then, the case is not quite hopeless,
  since the shark can only attack them from below; and a rapid dive, if
  not in very deep water, will sometimes save them.</p>

  <p>There are few who have not felt the charms of music, and
  acknowledged its expressions to he intelligible to the heart. It is a
  language of delightful sensations, that is far more eloquent than
  words: it breathes to the ear the clearest intimations; but how it
  was learned, to what origin we owe it, or what is the meaning of some
  of its most affecting strains, we know not.</p>

  <p>We feel plainly that music touches and gently agitates the
  agreeable and sublime passions; that it wraps us in melancholy, and
  elevates us to joy; that it dissolves and inflames; that it melts us
  into tenderness, and rouses into rage: but its strokes are so fine
  and delicate, that, like a tragedy, even the passions that are
  wounded please; its sorrows are charming, and its rage heroic and
  delightful. As people feel the particular passions with different
  degrees of force, their taste of harmony must proportionably vary.
  Music, then, is a language directed to the passions; but the rudest
  passions put on a new nature, and become pleasing in harmony: let me
  add, also, that it awakens some passions which we perceive not in
  ordinary life. Particularly the most elevated sensation of music
  arises from a confused perception of ideal or visionary beauty and
  rapture, which is sufficiently perceivable to fire the imagination,
  but not clear enough to become an object of knowledge. This shadowy
  beauty the mind attempts, with a languishing curiosity, to collect
  into a distinct object of view and comprehension; but it sinks and
  escapes, like the dissolving ideas of a delightful dream, that are
  neither within the reach of the memory, nor yet totally fled. The
  noblest charm of music, then, though real and affecting, seems too
  confused and fluid to be collected into a distinct idea.</p>

  <p>Harmony is always understood by the crowd, and almost always
  mistaken by musicians. The present Italian taste for music is exactly
  correspondent to the taste for tragi-comedy, that about a century ago
  gained ground upon the stage. The musicians of the present day are
  charmed at the union they form between the grave and the fantastic,
  and at the surprising transitions they make between extremes, while
  every hearer who has the least remainder of the taste of nature left,
  is shocked at the strange jargon. If the same taste should prevail in
  painting, we must soon expect to see the woman&#39;s head, a
  horse&#39;s body, and a fish&#39;s tail, united by soft gradations,
  greatly admired at our public exhibitions. Musical gentlemen should
  take particular care to preserve in its full vigour and sensibility
  their original natural taste, which alone feels and discovers the
  true beauty of music.</p>

  <p>If Milton, Shakspeare, or Dryden had been born with the same
  genius and inspiration for music as for poetry, and had passed
  through the practical part without corrupting the natural taste, or
  blending with it any prepossession in favour of sleights and
  dexterities of hand, then would their notes be tuned to passions and
  to sentiments as natural and expressive as the tones and modulations
  of the voice in discourse. The music and the thought would not make
  different expressions; the hearers would only think impetuously; and
  the effect of the music would be to give the ideas a tumultuous
  violence and divine impulse upon the mind. Any person conversant with
  the classic poets, sees instantly that the passionate power of music
  I speak of, was perfectly understood and practised by the
  ancients&mdash;that the Muses of the Greeks always sung, and their
  song was the echo of the subject, which swelled their poetry into
  enthusiasm and rapture. An inquiry into the nature and merits of the
  ancient music, and a comparison thereof with modern composition, by a
  person of poetic genius and an admirer of harmony, who is free from
  the shackles of practice, and the prejudices of the mode, aided by
  the countenance of a few men of rank, of elevated and true taste,
  would probably lay the present half-Gothic mode of music in ruins,
  like those towers of whose little laboured ornaments it is an exact
  picture, and restore the Grecian taste of passionate harmony once
  more to the delight and wonder of mankind. But as from the
  disposition of things, and the force of fashion, we cannot hope in
  our time to rescue the sacred lyre, and see it put into the hands of
  men of genius, I can only recall you to your own natural feeling of
  harmony and observe to you, that its emotions are not found in the
  laboured, fantastic, and surprising compositions that form the modern
  style of music: but you meet them in some few pieces that are the
  growth of wild unvitiated taste; you discover them in the swelling
  sounds that wrap us in imaginary grandeur; in those plaintive notes
  that make us in love with woe; in the tones that utter the
  lover&#39;s sighs, and fluctuate the breast with gentle pain; in the
  noble strokes that coil up the courage and fury of the soul, or that
  lull it in confused visions of joy; in short, in those affecting
  strains that find their way to the inmost recesses of the heart,</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
